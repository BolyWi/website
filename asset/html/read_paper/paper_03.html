                Nestled between hotels and conference centres, a short walk from the Las Vegas strip, is a giant,
                wide-eyed emoji. Sometimes it is an enormous, hyperrealistic eyeball, a basketball or a whorl of flames.
                The Sphere, a remarkable new concert venue, is 366 feet (110 metres) tall and 516 wide; an LED screen
                spanning almost 600,000 square feet covers the exterior. Inside, enveloping the 17,500 seats, is another
                vast, ultra-high-resolution screen. This pleasuredome offers an experience unlike any other. It also
                raises questions about the future of live entertainment.

                The high-tech arena was opened in September by U2, who remain in residence until March. The Irish band
                has a history of innovative concert design as well as corporate ventures, including a long partnership
                with Apple. Perhaps just as important, U2 is loved by middle-aged rock fans, who form the bulk of
                concertgoers in America and might shell out for a ticket. (Prices start at $140 and go up to $1,500.)

                From one angle, the Sphere represents a major development in an existing trend of the arts becoming more
                immersive. Exhibitions that turn the paintings of Monet or Van Gogh into interactive, room-encompassing
                installations have proliferated in recent years, as have immersive theatre productions. Virtual-reality
                technology has improved significantly.

                From another angle, it is part of the evolution of the modern rock concert, which since the 1960s has
                combined light and sound to transport fans into another dimension. At a show your correspondent attended
                at the Sphere in October, there were moments when the experience was transcendent. (There is a quiet
                room, filled with bean bags, for the over-stimulated.) Yet viewers still took their eyes off the big
                screen to reach for the smaller ones in their pockets. At times the band seemed like an expensive
                soundtrack to the bright lights.
            </p>
            <p>
                Is this the future of the concert? In the short term, no. The sheer cost of the Sphere—$2.3bn—means that
                the model cannot be easily reproduced. Its ostentation is also a barrier: Sadiq Khan, the mayor of
                London, recently vetoed a sister Sphere in the city, calling it “bulky, unduly dominant and
                incongruous”. Sphere Entertainment Company, the owner, hopes to build other iterations and is in
                “serious” talks for an arena in Abu Dhabi. But negotiations regarding Spheres in Saudi Arabia and South
                Korea have stalled. Some artists and promoters are said to be wary of developing shows that cannot be
                taken on tour to other, standard arenas and of letting the venue outshine the music. For now, at least,
                what happens in Vegas is staying there.
