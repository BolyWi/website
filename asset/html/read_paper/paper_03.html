                Nestled between hotels and conference centres, a short walk from the Las Vegas strip, is a giant,
                wide-eyed emoji. Sometimes it is an enormous, hyperrealistic eyeball, a basketball or a whorl of flames.
                The Sphere, a remarkable new concert venue, is 366 feet (110 metres) tall and 516 wide; an LED screen
                spanning almost 600,000 square feet covers the exterior. Inside, enveloping the 17,500 seats, is another
                vast, ultra-high-resolution screen. This pleasuredome offers an experience unlike any other. It also
                raises questions about the future of live entertainment.

                The high-tech arena was opened in September by U2, who remain in residence until March. The Irish band
                has a history of innovative concert design as well as corporate ventures, including a long partnership
                with Apple. Perhaps just as important, U2 is loved by middle-aged rock fans, who form the bulk of
                concertgoers in America and might shell out for a ticket. (Prices start at $140 and go up to $1,500.)
            </p>
            <p>
                From one angle, the Sphere represents a major development in an existing trend of the arts becoming more
                immersive. Exhibitions that turn the paintings of Monet or Van Gogh into interactive, room-encompassing
                installations have proliferated in recent years, as have immersive theatre productions. Virtual-reality
                technology has improved significantly.
            </p>
            <p>
                From another angle, it is part of the evolution of the modern rock concert, which since the 1960s has
                combined light and sound to transport fans into another dimension. At a show your correspondent attended
                at the Sphere in October, there were moments when the experience was transcendent. (There is a quiet
                room, filled with bean bags, for the over-stimulated.) Yet viewers still took their eyes off the big
                screen to reach for the smaller ones in their pockets. At times the band seemed like an expensive
                soundtrack to the bright lights.
            </p>
            <p>
                Is this the future of the concert? In the short term, no. The sheer cost of the Sphere—$2.3bn—means that
                the model cannot be easily reproduced. Its ostentation is also a barrier: Sadiq Khan, the mayor of
                London, recently vetoed a sister Sphere in the city, calling it “bulky, unduly dominant and
                incongruous”. Sphere Entertainment Company, the owner, hopes to build other iterations and is in
                “serious” talks for an arena in Abu Dhabi. But negotiations regarding Spheres in Saudi Arabia and South
                Korea have stalled. Some artists and promoters are said to be wary of developing shows that cannot be
                taken on tour to other, standard arenas and of letting the venue outshine the music. For now, at least,
                what happens in Vegas is staying there.

            <p>
                As we wend our way from toddlerhood to older adulthood, we have a desire to be useful. It's a
                fundamental aspect of human experience that evolves as we traverse different stages of life. From
                toddler years, when little ones eagerly mimic their parents in an effort to be helpful, to the later
                years, when adults find fulfillment in providing for their families or contributing to their
                communities, the need to feel useful runs deep.
            </p>
            <p>
                Toddlers are not merely playing make-believe when they attempt to assist parents with chores or
                activities; they seek validation and purpose through usefulness. The drive to feel useful is vital for
                their development, fostering confidence and autonomy as they grow. During adolescence, the urge for
                usefulness can surface through academic accomplishments or extracurricular activities, indicating their
                adolescent's value and significance to themselves and others.
            </p>
            <p>
                Adults find meaning and fulfillment in being of service to others. Young adulthood is fraught with the
                quest for identity and purpose. Feeling useful and needed helps young adults navigate this pivotal
                phase, anchoring them as they explore their place in the world (Fuligni, 2021). Middle age is a time
                when adults need their usefulness to be reflected in generative or outward-focused activities, such as
                caregiving, volunteering, or mentoring others.
            </p>
            <p>
                For some individuals, retirement can bring about loss of a sense of purpose and onset of feeling
                useless. The importance of engaging in activities that provide a sense of usefulness and fulfillment is
                key to maintaining well-being. Whether pursuing personal projects driven by intrinsic motivation, such
                as a hobby, or engaging in mentorship, finding avenues to contribute and feel useful can imbue life with
                purpose.
            </p>
            <p>
                Three Takeaways:
            <p>
                Nurturing usefulness from a young age: Recognize and encourage children's desire to be helpful. This
                fosters confidence and autonomy. Engaging them in age-appropriate tasks not only aids their development
                but also instills a sense of purpose and value from early on.
            </p>
            <p>
                Continuing to find purpose in adulthood: Whether through caregiving, volunteering, or pursuing personal
                passions, finding avenues to serve others enriches lives and provides a sense of fulfillment.
            </p>
            <p>
                Embracing meaningful engagement in retirement: Retirement offers an opportunity to reassess how to
                define
                usefulness and purpose. Actively seeking out activities that provide a sense of contribution and
                relevance can enhance overall well-being in this phase of life.
