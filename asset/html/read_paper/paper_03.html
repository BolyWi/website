                Nestled between hotels and conference centres, a short walk from the Las Vegas strip, is a giant,
                wide-eyed emoji. Sometimes it is an enormous, hyperrealistic eyeball, a basketball or a whorl of flames.
                The Sphere, a remarkable new concert venue, is 366 feet (110 metres) tall and 516 wide; an LED screen
                spanning almost 600,000 square feet covers the exterior. Inside, enveloping the 17,500 seats, is another
                vast, ultra-high-resolution screen. This pleasuredome offers an experience unlike any other. It also
                raises questions about the future of live entertainment.
            </p>
            <p>
                The high-tech arena was opened in September by U2, who remain in residence until March. The Irish band
                has a history of innovative concert design as well as corporate ventures, including a long partnership
                with Apple. Perhaps just as important, U2 is loved by middle-aged rock fans, who form the bulk of
                concertgoers in America and might shell out for a ticket. (Prices start at $140 and go up to $1,500.)
            </p>
            <p>
                From one angle, the Sphere represents a major development in an existing trend of the arts becoming more
                immersive. Exhibitions that turn the paintings of Monet or Van Gogh into interactive, room-encompassing
                installations have proliferated in recent years, as have immersive theatre productions. Virtual-reality
                technology has improved significantly.
            </p>
            <p>
                From another angle, it is part of the evolution of the modern rock concert, which since the 1960s has
                combined light and sound to transport fans into another dimension. At a show your correspondent attended
                at the Sphere in October, there were moments when the experience was transcendent. (There is a quiet
                room, filled with bean bags, for the over-stimulated.) Yet viewers still took their eyes off the big
                screen to reach for the smaller ones in their pockets. At times the band seemed like an expensive
                soundtrack to the bright lights.
            </p>
            <p>
                Is this the future of the concert? In the short term, no. The sheer cost of the Sphere—$2.3bn—means that
                the model cannot be easily reproduced. Its ostentation is also a barrier: Sadiq Khan, the mayor of
                London, recently vetoed a sister Sphere in the city, calling it “bulky, unduly dominant and
                incongruous”. Sphere Entertainment Company, the owner, hopes to build other iterations and is in
                “serious” talks for an arena in Abu Dhabi. But negotiations regarding Spheres in Saudi Arabia and South
                Korea have stalled. Some artists and promoters are said to be wary of developing shows that cannot be
                taken on tour to other, standard arenas and of letting the venue outshine the music. For now, at least,
                what happens in Vegas is staying there.

            <p>
                As we wend our way from toddlerhood to older adulthood, we have a desire to be useful. It's a
                fundamental aspect of human experience that evolves as we traverse different stages of life. From
                toddler years, when little ones eagerly mimic their parents in an effort to be helpful, to the later
                years, when adults find fulfillment in providing for their families or contributing to their
                communities, the need to feel useful runs deep.
            </p>
            <p>
                Toddlers are not merely playing make-believe when they attempt to assist parents with chores or
                activities; they seek validation and purpose through usefulness. The drive to feel useful is vital for
                their development, fostering confidence and autonomy as they grow. During adolescence, the urge for
                usefulness can surface through academic accomplishments or extracurricular activities, indicating their
                adolescent's value and significance to themselves and others.
            </p>
            <p>
                Adults find meaning and fulfillment in being of service to others. Young adulthood is fraught with the
                quest for identity and purpose. Feeling useful and needed helps young adults navigate this pivotal
                phase, anchoring them as they explore their place in the world (Fuligni, 2021). Middle age is a time
                when adults need their usefulness to be reflected in generative or outward-focused activities, such as
                caregiving, volunteering, or mentoring others.
            </p>
            <p>
                For some individuals, retirement can bring about loss of a sense of purpose and onset of feeling
                useless. The importance of engaging in activities that provide a sense of usefulness and fulfillment is
                key to maintaining well-being. Whether pursuing personal projects driven by intrinsic motivation, such
                as a hobby, or engaging in mentorship, finding avenues to contribute and feel useful can imbue life with
                purpose.
            </p>
            <p>
                Three Takeaways:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Nurturing usefulness from a young age: Recognize and encourage children's desire to be helpful.
                    This fosters confidence and autonomy. Engaging them in age-appropriate tasks not only aids their
                    development but also instills a sense of purpose and value from early on.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Continuing to find purpose in adulthood: Whether through caregiving, volunteering, or pursuing
                    personal passions, finding avenues to serve others enriches lives and provides a sense of
                    fulfillment.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Embracing meaningful engagement in retirement: Retirement offers an opportunity to reassess how
                    to define usefulness and purpose. Actively seeking out activities that provide a sense of
                    contribution and relevance can enhance overall well-being in this phase of life.

        <div class="paragraph-content">
            <p>
                Designed in 1859 by Eugène Viollet-le-Duc, an architect, and felled by the devastating fire of 2019, the
                new flèche remains hidden behind dense scaffolding. But five years after the world watched aghast as the
                gothic cathedral roof was devoured by flames, the project to rebuild Notre Dame is, astonishingly, on
                schedule. The cathedral doors are due to reopen in December. (Visitors for the Olympics, which Paris
                will host starting in late July, must wait to glimpse inside.)
            </p>
            <p>
                The rebuilding of Notre Dame is one of the most complex and ambitious reconstruction projects that
                France has ever undertaken on a historic monument. Fire engulfed the entire wooden latticework that made
                up the medieval roof, before melting its lead casing and toppling the spire. The cathedral’s nave, choir
                and transepts were mostly untouched by flames, thanks to the craftsmanship of the 12th- and 13th-century
                stonemasons. So were the 8,000-tube great organ and stained-glass windows.
            </p>
            <p>
                When a grave-looking President Emmanuel Macron stood outside Notre Dame on the night of the fire, he
                described it as “the epicentre of our lives”. The cathedral would be rebuilt, he vowed, within five
                years. That the project is on track is also partly due to the commanding style of General Jean-Louis
                Georgelin, who ran it like a military operation until his death last August. A light management team,
                freed from bureaucratic excess has helped, too. Gifts from rich French industrialists—the Arnault,
                Bettencourt and Pinault families—as well as 340,000 smaller individual donations from around the world
                amounted to €846m ($921m). Unlike the usual French grands projects, this one is costing the public purse
                almost nothing.
            </p>
            <p>
                The craftsmen working on the project are specialist artisans, drawn from dozens of small firms from
                around France. Rather than contract the rebuilding to one company, over 140 separate tenders were put
                out, in order to support traditional craftsmanship. The demands were unusually high: a decision was
                taken to restore the cathedral to its former splendour while remaining faithful both to its original
                designs and the construction techniques of the time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Inevitably some modernists decry the project’s conservatism. After the fire, various architects lobbied
                for an audacious contemporary flourish: a plate-glass spire or roof planted with vegetation. Notre Dame,
                after all, is an architectural hybrid, the product of different centuries, ransacked during the wars of
                religion and looted during the revolution.Today a public debate pits those who contest the authenticity
                of reconstruction against those who argue that authenticity is guaranteed by respect for the original,
                with its irregularities as well as its durability. “This is not a monument like any other, and deserves
                not being distorted,” says Mr Jost: “We are restoring a cathedral that is 860 years old so that it can
                last for at least another 860 years.”

                Adding fluoride, a common mineral, to drinking water lessens tooth decay in children and adults by 25%.
                The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calls fluoridation, which began in 1946 in the United
                States and is decided by local water districts, one of 10 “great public health achievements” of the 20th
                century. But from the getgo, some activist groups worried about potential harm. And over the past few
                decades, studies of laboratory animals and of communities where drinking water naturally contains
                fluoride have hinted that high levels might affect brain development.
            </p>
            <p>
                The current case has put the spotlight on an unpublished assessment by the federal government’s National
                Toxicology Program (NTP). It reported “moderate confidence” that drinking water containing fluoride at
                levels at least twice as high as those recommended by the federal government is associated with lower IQ
                in children. The Fluoride Action Network (FAN) and other groups argue that such data indicate EPA should
                be regulating fluoride under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA).
            </p>
            <p>
                During opening arguments on 31 January, the attorney for the plaintiffs, Michael Connett, highlighted
                babies fed formula made with tap water as a “critical vulnerable group being exposed to the highest dose
                of fluoride of any age group in the population. That is a major cause for concern.” He argued that if
                EPA was aware of a different compound that posed a similar potential threat to newborns, the agency
                wouldn’t hesitate to regulate it. “I don’t think we need to speculate about what EPA would do with that
                scenario,” he said.
            </p>
            <p>
                EPA and others argue there is little strong evidence that the current recommended concentration of
                fluoride in drinking water— 0.7 milligrams per liter—poses a threat. (That level is set to avoid
                discoloration of teeth in children.) “The dose makes the poison,” said Paul Caintic, a Department of
                Justice attorney. “Given the current state of science, the court cannot conclude that community water
                fluoridation presents an unreasonable risk.”
            </p>
            <p>
                The fluoride lawsuit is the first to reach trial under a 2016 TSCA provision allowing citizens to ask a
                court to assess a chemical’s risk. FAN turned to that strategy after EPA said its request that the
                agency ban fluoridation lacked a “scientifically defensible basis.”

                Handwriting notes in class might seem like an anachronism as smartphones and other digital technology
                subsume every aspect of learning across schools and universities. But a steady stream of research
                continues to suggest that taking notes the traditional way—with pen and paper or even stylus and
                tablet—is still the best way to learn, especially for young children. And now scientists are finally
                zeroing in on why.
            </p>
            <p>
                The new research, by Audrey van der Meer and Ruud van der Weel at the Norwegian University of Science
                and Technology (NTNU), builds on a foundational 2014 study. That work suggested that people taking notes
                by computer were typing without thinking, says van der Meer, a professor of neuropsychology at NTNU.
                “It’s very tempting to type down everything that the lecturer is saying,” she says. “It kind of goes in
                through your ears and comes out through your fingertips, but you don’t process the incoming
                information.”
            </p>
            <p>
                But when taking notes by hand, it’s often impossible to write everything down; students have to actively
                pay attention to the incoming information and process it—prioritize it, consolidate it and try to relate
                it to things they’ve learned before. This conscious action of building onto existing knowledge can make
                it easier to stay engaged and grasp new concepts.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sophia Vinci-Booher, an assistant professor of educational neuroscience at Vanderbilt University who was
                not involved in the new study, says its findings are exciting and consistent with past research. “You
                can see that in tasks that really lock the motor and sensory systems together, such as in handwriting,
                there’s this really clear tie between this motor action being accomplished and the visual and conceptual
                recognition being created,” she says. “As you’re drawing a letter or writing a word, you’re taking this
                perceptual understanding of something and using your motor system to create it.”
            </p>

                That creation is then fed back into the visual system, where it’s processed again—strengthening the
                connection between an action and the images or words associated with it. It’s similar to imagining
                something and then creating it: when you materialize something from your imagination (by writing it,
                drawing it or building it), this reinforces the imagined concept and helps it stick in your memory.

                Let’s assume, however, that your livelihood does not rely on spreading misery. Much more likely is that
                it will be in your interest, if you have a complaining habit, to break it. The people you care about
                will be happier too. Here are four, research-based ways to quit complaining.
            </p>
            <p>
                Judge less, observe more. Complaining is a fundamentally egotistical act—subjecting something about the
                world to your judgment. This is completely natural, of course, because we are all walking receivers of
                outside stimuli. However, as I have previously written, you can also decide to turn down the sensitivity
                of the receiver by trying to observe more about the outside world without judgment. Tomorrow, try to
                reframe what were today’s minor irritations as simple events. For example, instead of bitching about
                someone who cuts you off in traffic, simply observe that the person is obviously in a hurry. Be more of
                a play-by-play announcer of the game of your life, and less of a color commentator or pundit.
            </p>
            <p>
                Consider the underlying problem. If you have a habit of complaining, you could find it worthwhile to dig
                into why you’re so often going over your dissatisfaction threshold. We’ve established that grumbling
                probably makes you unhappier, but the causality can run in the other direction: Constant
                complaining—being hypercritical about everything—can be a symptom of depression. For my own part, I’ve
                noticed that when something big is disturbing me, I also get impatient about all the little things I
                don’t like. Perhaps if you deal with what is really bothering you, you’ll find that the weather and
                politics aren’t really worth complaining about.
            </p>
            <p>
                Be a Stoic. Most people think that to be a stoic means keeping a stiff upper lip in the face of misery,
                but that is a misunderstanding of capital-s Stoic philosophy. In fact, the Stoics, such as Roman Emperor
                Marcus Aurelius, managed their feelings about life’s trials through reason. In his Meditations, Marcus
                wrote this advice to himself: “If it be in thy power, redress what is amiss; if it be not, to what end
                is it to complain? For nothing should be done but to some certain end.” So when you are about to
                complain, subject your complaint to the Stoic test: Can you do something about the situation? If not,
                then complaining won’t help. If you can, then get on with that (and don’t waste time complaining).
            </p>
            <p>
                Avoid the grumblers. One reason you complain a lot might be that you keep negative company, online or in
                person. Curate your personal life to the extent that you can, and turn off the complaint machines in
                your media—the querulous celebrities on X, the crabby pundits on television, and the whinging columnists
                in print. Remember, your misery is their business model.

                The layoffs have shifted the narrative that long defined working at Google — that it was more of a
                tinker’ community than a workaday office, where creativity and thinking out of the box was encouraged.
                That it was a fun, different kind of place to work. Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive, said more
                than a year ago that the company would cull 12,000 jobs, or 6 percent of the work force, describing it
                as “a difficult decision to set us up for the future.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Those cuts have trickled into this year in what Mr. Pichai said could be much smaller, rolling layoffs
                throughout the year. Since early January, the company has cut more than a thousand jobs, affecting its
                ad sales division, YouTube and employees working on the company’s voice-operated assistant.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alphabet, Google’s parent company, has said it is trying to shed expenses to pay for its growing
                investment in artificial intelligence. And Google is trying to reduce layers of bureaucracy so that
                employees can focus on the biggest company priorities, said Courtenay Mencini, a Google spokeswoman. The
                company added that it was not conducting a companywide layoff, and that reorganizations were part of the
                normal course of business.
            </p>
            <p>
                Employees say the workplace mood has turned glum. While Google has shifted into overdrive to develop
                artificial intelligence products and keep pace with competitors like Microsoft and the start-up OpenAI,
                some of the humans that build the company’s technology feel less important.
            </p>
            <p>
                Google’s layoffs have been smaller than those at some other big tech companies like Meta. And as a
                percentage of the company’s total work force, they are far smaller than recent cuts at companies like
                Xerox and the livestreaming platform Twitch. Google’s full-time work force was 182,502 at the end of
                2023, just 4 percent smaller than at the end of 2022. On Tuesday, the company said it had a $20.7
                billion profit in the last quarter of 2023, up 52 percent from a year earlier. But Google’s job cuts
                have accompanied broader changes in how the company operated as it reshuffled work groups and removed
                management layers. Workers complain that reorganization has been chaotically carried out and poorly
                communicated.

            <p>
                Whenever you’re actively performing a task—say, lifting weights at the gym or taking a hard exam—the
                parts of your brain required to carry it out become “active” when neurons step up their electrical
                activity. But is your brain active even when you’re zoning out on the couch?
            </p>
            <p>
                The answer, researchers have found, is yes. Over the past two decades they’ve defined what’s known as
                the default mode network, a collection of seemingly unrelated areas of the brain that activate when
                you’re not doing much at all. Its discovery has offered insights into how the brain functions outside of
                well-defined tasks and has also prompted research into the role of brain networks—not just brain
                regions—in managing our internal experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                Researchers called these areas “task negative.” When they were first identified, Marcus Raichle, a
                neurologist at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, suspected that these
                task-negative areas play an important role in the resting mind. “This raised the question of ‘What’s
                baseline brain activity?’” Raichle recalled. In an experiment, he asked people in scanners to close
                their eyes and simply let their minds wander while he measured their brain activity.
            </p>
            <p>
                He found that during rest, when we turn mentally inward, task-negative areas use more energy than the
                rest of the brain. In a 2001 paper, he dubbed this activity “a default mode of brain function.” Two
                years later, after generating higher-resolution data, a team from the Stanford University School of
                Medicine discovered that this task-negative activity defines a coherent network of interacting brain
                regions, which they called the default mode network.
            </p>
            <p>
                According to research, the effects of the default mode network include mind wandering, remembering past
                experiences, thinking about others’ mental states, envisioning the future, and processing language.
                While this may seem like a grab bag of unrelated aspects of cognition, Vinod Menon, the director of the
                Stanford Cognitive & Systems Neuroscience Laboratory, recently theorized that all of these functions may
                be helpful in constructing an internal narrative. In his view, the default mode network helps you think
                about who you are in relation to others, recall your past experiences, and then wrap up all of that into
                a coherent self-narrative. </p>
