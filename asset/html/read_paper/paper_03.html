                Nestled between hotels and conference centres, a short walk from the Las Vegas strip, is a giant,
                wide-eyed emoji. Sometimes it is an enormous, hyperrealistic eyeball, a basketball or a whorl of flames.
                The Sphere, a remarkable new concert venue, is 366 feet (110 metres) tall and 516 wide; an LED screen
                spanning almost 600,000 square feet covers the exterior. Inside, enveloping the 17,500 seats, is another
                vast, ultra-high-resolution screen. This pleasuredome offers an experience unlike any other. It also
                raises questions about the future of live entertainment.

                The high-tech arena was opened in September by U2, who remain in residence until March. The Irish band
                has a history of innovative concert design as well as corporate ventures, including a long partnership
                with Apple. Perhaps just as important, U2 is loved by middle-aged rock fans, who form the bulk of
                concertgoers in America and might shell out for a ticket. (Prices start at $140 and go up to $1,500.)
            </p>
            <p>
                From one angle, the Sphere represents a major development in an existing trend of the arts becoming more
                immersive. Exhibitions that turn the paintings of Monet or Van Gogh into interactive, room-encompassing
                installations have proliferated in recent years, as have immersive theatre productions. Virtual-reality
                technology has improved significantly.
            </p>
            <p>
                From another angle, it is part of the evolution of the modern rock concert, which since the 1960s has
                combined light and sound to transport fans into another dimension. At a show your correspondent attended
                at the Sphere in October, there were moments when the experience was transcendent. (There is a quiet
                room, filled with bean bags, for the over-stimulated.) Yet viewers still took their eyes off the big
                screen to reach for the smaller ones in their pockets. At times the band seemed like an expensive
                soundtrack to the bright lights.
            </p>
            <p>
                Is this the future of the concert? In the short term, no. The sheer cost of the Sphere—$2.3bn—means that
                the model cannot be easily reproduced. Its ostentation is also a barrier: Sadiq Khan, the mayor of
                London, recently vetoed a sister Sphere in the city, calling it “bulky, unduly dominant and
                incongruous”. Sphere Entertainment Company, the owner, hopes to build other iterations and is in
                “serious” talks for an arena in Abu Dhabi. But negotiations regarding Spheres in Saudi Arabia and South
                Korea have stalled. Some artists and promoters are said to be wary of developing shows that cannot be
                taken on tour to other, standard arenas and of letting the venue outshine the music. For now, at least,
                what happens in Vegas is staying there.

            <p>
                As we wend our way from toddlerhood to older adulthood, we have a desire to be useful. It's a
                fundamental aspect of human experience that evolves as we traverse different stages of life. From
                toddler years, when little ones eagerly mimic their parents in an effort to be helpful, to the later
                years, when adults find fulfillment in providing for their families or contributing to their
                communities, the need to feel useful runs deep.
            </p>
            <p>
                Toddlers are not merely playing make-believe when they attempt to assist parents with chores or
                activities; they seek validation and purpose through usefulness. The drive to feel useful is vital for
                their development, fostering confidence and autonomy as they grow. During adolescence, the urge for
                usefulness can surface through academic accomplishments or extracurricular activities, indicating their
                adolescent's value and significance to themselves and others.
            </p>
            <p>
                Adults find meaning and fulfillment in being of service to others. Young adulthood is fraught with the
                quest for identity and purpose. Feeling useful and needed helps young adults navigate this pivotal
                phase, anchoring them as they explore their place in the world (Fuligni, 2021). Middle age is a time
                when adults need their usefulness to be reflected in generative or outward-focused activities, such as
                caregiving, volunteering, or mentoring others.
            </p>
            <p>
                For some individuals, retirement can bring about loss of a sense of purpose and onset of feeling
                useless. The importance of engaging in activities that provide a sense of usefulness and fulfillment is
                key to maintaining well-being. Whether pursuing personal projects driven by intrinsic motivation, such
                as a hobby, or engaging in mentorship, finding avenues to contribute and feel useful can imbue life with
                purpose.
            </p>
            <p>
                Three Takeaways:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Nurturing usefulness from a young age: Recognize and encourage children's desire to be helpful.
                    This fosters confidence and autonomy. Engaging them in age-appropriate tasks not only aids their
                    development but also instills a sense of purpose and value from early on.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Continuing to find purpose in adulthood: Whether through caregiving, volunteering, or pursuing
                    personal passions, finding avenues to serve others enriches lives and provides a sense of
                    fulfillment.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Embracing meaningful engagement in retirement: Retirement offers an opportunity to reassess how
                    to define usefulness and purpose. Actively seeking out activities that provide a sense of
                    contribution and relevance can enhance overall well-being in this phase of life.

        <div class="paragraph-content">
            <p>
                Designed in 1859 by Eugène Viollet-le-Duc, an architect, and felled by the devastating fire of 2019, the
                new flèche remains hidden behind dense scaffolding. But five years after the world watched aghast as the
                gothic cathedral roof was devoured by flames, the project to rebuild Notre Dame is, astonishingly, on
                schedule. The cathedral doors are due to reopen in December. (Visitors for the Olympics, which Paris
                will host starting in late July, must wait to glimpse inside.)
            </p>
            <p>
                The rebuilding of Notre Dame is one of the most complex and ambitious reconstruction projects that
                France has ever undertaken on a historic monument. Fire engulfed the entire wooden latticework that made
                up the medieval roof, before melting its lead casing and toppling the spire. The cathedral’s nave, choir
                and transepts were mostly untouched by flames, thanks to the craftsmanship of the 12th- and 13th-century
                stonemasons. So were the 8,000-tube great organ and stained-glass windows.
            </p>
            <p>
                When a grave-looking President Emmanuel Macron stood outside Notre Dame on the night of the fire, he
                described it as “the epicentre of our lives”. The cathedral would be rebuilt, he vowed, within five
                years. That the project is on track is also partly due to the commanding style of General Jean-Louis
                Georgelin, who ran it like a military operation until his death last August. A light management team,
                freed from bureaucratic excess has helped, too. Gifts from rich French industrialists—the Arnault,
                Bettencourt and Pinault families—as well as 340,000 smaller individual donations from around the world
                amounted to €846m ($921m). Unlike the usual French grands projects, this one is costing the public purse
                almost nothing.
            </p>
            <p>
                The craftsmen working on the project are specialist artisans, drawn from dozens of small firms from
                around France. Rather than contract the rebuilding to one company, over 140 separate tenders were put
                out, in order to support traditional craftsmanship. The demands were unusually high: a decision was
                taken to restore the cathedral to its former splendour while remaining faithful both to its original
                designs and the construction techniques of the time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Inevitably some modernists decry the project’s conservatism. After the fire, various architects lobbied
                for an audacious contemporary flourish: a plate-glass spire or roof planted with vegetation. Notre Dame,
                after all, is an architectural hybrid, the product of different centuries, ransacked during the wars of
                religion and looted during the revolution.Today a public debate pits those who contest the authenticity
                of reconstruction against those who argue that authenticity is guaranteed by respect for the original,
                with its irregularities as well as its durability. “This is not a monument like any other, and deserves
                not being distorted,” says Mr Jost: “We are restoring a cathedral that is 860 years old so that it can
                last for at least another 860 years.”
