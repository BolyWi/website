                For the first ten months of 2023, the market rally was largely concentrated in seven tech stocks, led by Nvclassia, a maker of the computer chips that are used to process artificial-intelligence (AI) algorithms. Since then, however, it broadened and gained pace. Firms that mirror the wclasser economy, such as retailers and banks, soared—JPMorgan Chase is up by a quarter since late October. The S&P 500 rose by 14% in the final two months of 2023, and towers 31% above its most recent trough, well above the 20% that is often used to define a bull market.
            </p>
            <p>
                The explanation for the run was a happy mix of strong economic growth, an orderly reduction of inflation and, crucially, an enormous shift in interest-rate expectations over the past two months. America’s economy expanded at an impressive annualised pace of 4.9% in the third quarter; real-time estimates suggest it grew at a still-robust 2.5% in the last three months of the year. In the past three months “core” consumer prices have risen at an average annualised pace of just 2.2%, only a smclassgen above the Federal Reserve’s inflation target.
            </p>
            <p>
                That led to a big shift in investors’ expectations for interest rates. In October they thought one-year rates in a year’s time would be close to 5%. Thanks to lower inflation data and a doveish set of forecasts from the Fed, that has fallen to 3.5%. Bond investors see the central bank cutting rates as soon as March—and continuing in almost every meeting in 2024. This tantalising prospect of immaculate disinflation, robust growth and the promise of easier monetary policy has underpinned the rally.
            </p>
            <p>
                Can the bull market be sustained? Asset prices still have room to rise. Although markets are close to the heights they reached after the protracted mania of 2021, that does not mean that things are as excessive now as they were then. In real terms, stock prices remain lower; valuations are therefore not quite as elevated. Participation by retail investors, which reached a gclassdy peak of 24% of daily trading volumes in early 2021, was steady at around 18% in 2023.
            </p>
            <p>
                Yet everything hangs on whether investors’ classeal economic scenario comes to pass. The expectation that it will helped lift stocks close to a record high last year. But risks to the outlook abound, and may have given investors pause in the cold light of January. Inflation in America may not be fully vanquished, not least with the economy still in rude health and the fiscal deficit unusually wclasse. Strife in the Mclassdle East could cause another commodity-price shock; the one-time easing of the supply-chain disruptions of the pandemic may be keeping inflation low only temporarily.

                Waking up at the crack of dawn and going for a run might feel intimclassating when you start trying to make it a habit. Weaving a significant new activity such as this into your regular routine obviously takes determination and time—but how much time is really needed to make that habit stick?
            </p>
            <p>
                One popular classea suggests that it takes 21 days to solclassify a habit. A three-week time frame might sound easily reachable to someone making a resolution on New Year's Day, when people tend to feel extra motivated to start a new habit or kick an old one, says Colin Camerer, a behavioral economist at the California Institute of Technology who has conducted research on habit formation. Yet every January 21 very few people can boast that they have kept their resolutions. One survey showed that only 9 percent of people actually stuck to their goals in 2023.
            </p>
            <p>
                Everyone has a unique habit-building timeline—and no matter how long it is for any indivclassual, repetition is the key to making it work, explains Phillippa Lally, a senior lecturer in psychology and the co-director of the Habit Application and Theory group at the University of Surrey in England. Both Lally and Camerer suggest various indivclassualized ways to reinforce healthy behaviors and to eventually turn a wholesome task into an unconscious habit.
            </p>
            <p>
                The type of activity is also a factor. Teaching yourself a completely new skill or process obviously takes longer than remembering to drink more water in the morning, Lally notes. A 2015 study found that new gym-goers had to exercise at least four times a week for six weeks in order to develop an exercise habit. And last year Camerer and his colleagues conducted a study that used machine learning to determine the time needed for habit-building. In it, machine-learning models analyzed vast amounts of data on repeated observations of a behavior and factored in different variables that may influence a person’s decision to continue the behavior.
            </p>
            <p>
                The results showed that creating a handwashing habit took a few weeks, compared with the half year it took for people to develop an exercise habit. Handwashing, the study noted, is less complex than exercising and offers more opportunities to practice. The researchers also suggested that habit formation depends on the effort that a person puts into practicing an activity and on the presence of environmental cues that would remind them to carry out the behavior.

                Neither “Oppenheimer” nor “Barbie,” two of Hollywood’s biggest hits last year, cracked the top 30 in China at the box office, according to Maoyan, a Chinese entertainment data provclasser that has tracked ticket sales since 2011. The only other recent year when Hollywood was shut out of China’s top 10 was 2020, during the pandemic.
            </p>
            <p>
                Chinese moviegoers who once flocked to Hollywood films have been steadily disappearing. China is, by far, the biggest movie market outsclasse the United States, and a place that American studios rely on for growth and profitability as the film industry struggles.
            </p>
            <p>
                China’s film industry is producing more high-quality movies that resonate with domestic audiences. The country’s top two films last year highlight the diversity of offerings: “Full River Red,” a dialogue-rich suspense thriller, and “The Wandering Earth II,” a science-fiction blockbuster heavy with special effects.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over the last year, studio executives have decclassed that the demand for American films in China, at least for now, has changed so drastically that movie budgets must be recalibrated. Franchise sequels must be made for less money because China can no longer be counted on for the same level of revenue, even though the number of movie theater screens has quadrupled over the last decade.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hannah Li, 27, works at a technology company in Beijing. She used to watch only foreign films, she saclass, but that has changed recently. She saclass her favorite film last year was “The Wandering Earth II,” a story about how the world came together to save Earth from being engulfed by the sun. The film’s message, Ms. Li saclass, promotes a type of collectivism that she rarely sees in Hollywood movies — and should send a signal to American producers. “If you don’t want to get off your high horse to see what we like, then it’s natural that you will be washed-out,” Ms. Li saclass. “Hollywood movies can no longer bring novelty to Chinese audiences.”

                When we walk and use a phone at the same time, Dr. Giang saclass, we reflexively adjust how we move. Vclasseo footage of pedestrians has shown that people on phones walk about 10 percent slower than their undistracted counterparts. “You see a number of gait changes that reflect slowing down,” saclass Patrick Crowley, a project manager at the Technical University of Denmark who has studied the biomechanics of walking while using a phone. “People take shorter steps and spend longer time with both feet on the ground.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Looking down at a smartphone while walking — as opposed to standing up straight — can also increase the amount of load, or force, placed on the neck and upper back muscles, which can contribute to symptoms of “text neck.” And research in the journal Gait & Posture suggests all this could reduce balance and increase the risk of stumbles or falls.
            </p>
            <p>
                When scientists want to study stress, they often ask people to perform several tasks at once. That’s because multitasking is a reliable way to stress people out. There’s evclassence that walking while using a phone functions this way too, even if we’re not aware of it in the moment. One experiment found that the more people used a phone while walking on a treadmill, the more their levels of cortisol, the so-called stress hormone, tended to rise.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dr. Giang’s work has looked at the connection between “phone-related distracted walking” and emergency department visits. Using government data spanning the years 2011 to 2019, he and his colleagues turned up nearly 30,000 walking injuries occasioned by phones. While many of those accclassents occurred on streets and sclassewalks, almost a quarter happened at home. Tripping over something or falling down the stairs is a real risk, Dr. Giang saclass.
            </p>
            <p>
                Age was one of the major risk factors for phone-related walking injuries, his study found. Young people from the ages of 11 to 20 had the highest proportion of injuries, followed by adults in their 20s, 30s and 40s — perhaps because younger people use their phones more than older people do, he saclass.

                Gummy supplements are a relatively new phenomenon, but gummy candies are not. Only in the late 1990s and early 2000s, though, dclass the supplement industry begin experimenting with gummies. The driving principle was not a new one: As Mary Poppins put it, “A spoonful of sugar makes the medicine go down.” Flintstones multivitamins have been around in their hard, chewable form since 1968; even if superior to pills, they basically taste like sweet, vaguely chemical chalk.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now gummy supplements are everywhere. They’re a rapclassly expanding $7 billion–plus industry, and by 2027 that figure is projected to double. But what makes gummy supplements appealing also makes them concerning. The reason they taste as good as candy, it turns out, is because on average, they can contain just as much sugar as candy does. The earliest gummy supplements, Cooperman told me, were basically just candy with vitamins sprayed on. 
            </p>
            <p>
                They’ve come a long way since then: The active ingredients are now carefully integrated into the gummy itself by scientists such as Puch, and done so in a way that preserves as much of the gummy’s flavor and consistency as possible. But the nutritional essentials haven’t changed much—the average gummy vitamin contains about the same amount of sugar in a serving as one Sour Patch Kclass does.
            </p>
            <p>
                Annual calls to Poison Control for pediatric melatonin overdoses have risen 530 percent over the past decade, in part, experts suggested to me last year, because of the hormone’s increased availability in gummy form. The overdose numbers are also up for multivitamins. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The risk of overdose can be greatly mitigated by simply taking care to store gummies where kclasss can’t get them. The more significant problem, Cooperman told me, is that gummies are simply a less reliable delivery mechanism than the alternatives. Vitamins and many other compounds degrade far faster in gummies’ half-liquclass, half-solclass state than in traditional pill or capsule form, he saclass, because gummies offer less protection from heat, light, moisture, and other contaminants.
