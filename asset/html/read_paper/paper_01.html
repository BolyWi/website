                A knitted wool sweater may be one of the warmest pieces of clothing to grab when temperatures turn
                chilly, but this insulating material can often be downright itchy when wearing it. So, what is it about
                wool that triggers us to itch uncontrollably?
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the main reasons an otherwise cozy piece of clothing can go from being comfortable to unbearable
                is the thickness of the wool fibers used to make the item. "The thicker the fiber, the itchier the wool
                will be," Ingun Grimstad Klepp, an ethnologist and professor of clothing and sustainability at Oslo
                Metropolitan University in Norway, told Live Science. "That's one factor. Another is the softness of the
                fibers used to make the yarn."
            </p>
            <p>
                In other words, a thicker fiber spun by humans will likely be more abrasive and less flexible, which can
                lead to itching and irritation on the skin, while thinner, softer fibers, such as merino wool and
                downy-like alpaca fleece, can help " ditch the itch."
            </p>
            <p>
                Another less common cause of itchiness is the presence of lanolin, a waxy substance secreted by the
                sebaceous glands of wool-bearing animals. Also called wool wax or wool grease, lanolin is great for
                repairing dry, chapped skin, but it can also cause an allergic response in some people, according to
                Healthline.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Wool isn't an allergen in and of itself, but it is possible to be allergic to lanolin," Grimstad Klepp
                said. "However, most wool today doesn't contain much lanolin because the majority of it has been washed
                and dyed out during production, so there's not much lanolin left in the yarn."
