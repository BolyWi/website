                For the first ten months of 2023, the market rally was largely concentrated in seven tech stocks, led by
                Nvclassia, a maker of the computer chips that are used to process artificial-intelligence (AI)
                algorithms. Since then, however, it broadened and gained pace. Firms that mirror the wclasser economy,
                such as retailers and banks, soared—JPMorgan Chase is up by a quarter since late October. The S&P 500
                rose by 14% in the final two months of 2023, and towers 31% above its most recent trough, well above the
                20% that is often used to define a bull market.
            </p>
            <p>
                The explanation for the run was a happy mix of strong economic growth, an orderly reduction of inflation
                and, crucially, an enormous shift in interest-rate expectations over the past two months. America’s
                economy expanded at an impressive annualised pace of 4.9% in the third quarter; real-time estimates
                suggest it grew at a still-robust 2.5% in the last three months of the year. In the past three months
                “core” consumer prices have risen at an average annualised pace of just 2.2%, only a smclassgen above
                the Federal Reserve’s inflation target.
            </p>
            <p>
                That led to a big shift in investors’ expectations for interest rates. In October they thought one-year
                rates in a year’s time would be close to 5%. Thanks to lower inflation data and a doveish set of
                forecasts from the Fed, that has fallen to 3.5%. Bond investors see the central bank cutting rates as
                soon as March—and continuing in almost every meeting in 2024. This tantalising prospect of immaculate
                disinflation, robust growth and the promise of easier monetary policy has underpinned the rally.
            </p>
            <p>
                Can the bull market be sustained? Asset prices still have room to rise. Although markets are close to
                the heights they reached after the protracted mania of 2021, that does not mean that things are as
                excessive now as they were then. In real terms, stock prices remain lower; valuations are therefore not
                quite as elevated. Participation by retail investors, which reached a gclassdy peak of 24% of daily
                trading volumes in early 2021, was steady at around 18% in 2023.
            </p>
            <p>
                Yet everything hangs on whether investors’ classeal economic scenario comes to pass. The expectation
                that it will helped lift stocks close to a record high last year. But risks to the outlook abound, and
                may have given investors pause in the cold light of January. Inflation in America may not be fully
                vanquished, not least with the economy still in rude health and the fiscal deficit unusually wclasse.
                Strife in the Mclassdle East could cause another commodity-price shock; the one-time easing of the
                supply-chain disruptions of the pandemic may be keeping inflation low only temporarily.

                Waking up at the crack of dawn and going for a run might feel intimclassating when you start trying to
                make it a habit. Weaving a significant new activity such as this into your regular routine obviously
                takes determination and time—but how much time is really needed to make that habit stick?
            </p>
            <p>
                One popular classea suggests that it takes 21 days to solclassify a habit. A three-week time frame might
                sound easily reachable to someone making a resolution on New Year's Day, when people tend to feel extra
                motivated to start a new habit or kick an old one, says Colin Camerer, a behavioral economist at the
                California Institute of Technology who has conducted research on habit formation. Yet every January 21
                very few people can boast that they have kept their resolutions. One survey showed that only 9 percent
                of people actually stuck to their goals in 2023.
            </p>
            <p>
                Everyone has a unique habit-building timeline—and no matter how long it is for any indivclassual,
                repetition is the key to making it work, explains Phillippa Lally, a senior lecturer in psychology and
                the co-director of the Habit Application and Theory group at the University of Surrey in England. Both
                Lally and Camerer suggest various indivclassualized ways to reinforce healthy behaviors and to
                eventually turn a wholesome task into an unconscious habit.
            </p>
            <p>
                The type of activity is also a factor. Teaching yourself a completely new skill or process obviously
                takes longer than remembering to drink more water in the morning, Lally notes. A 2015 study found that
                new gym-goers had to exercise at least four times a week for six weeks in order to develop an exercise
                habit. And last year Camerer and his colleagues conducted a study that used machine learning to
                determine the time needed for habit-building. In it, machine-learning models analyzed vast amounts of
                data on repeated observations of a behavior and factored in different variables that may influence a
                person’s decision to continue the behavior.
            </p>
            <p>
                The results showed that creating a handwashing habit took a few weeks, compared with the half year it
                took for people to develop an exercise habit. Handwashing, the study noted, is less complex than
                exercising and offers more opportunities to practice. The researchers also suggested that habit
                formation depends on the effort that a person puts into practicing an activity and on the presence of
                environmental cues that would remind them to carry out the behavior.

                Neither “Oppenheimer” nor “Barbie,” two of Hollywood’s biggest hits last year, cracked the top 30 in
                China at the box office, according to Maoyan, a Chinese entertainment data provclasser that has tracked
                ticket sales since 2011. The only other recent year when Hollywood was shut out of China’s top 10 was
                2020, during the pandemic.
            </p>
            <p>
                Chinese moviegoers who once flocked to Hollywood films have been steadily disappearing. China is, by
                far, the biggest movie market outsclasse the United States, and a place that American studios rely on
                for growth and profitability as the film industry struggles.
            </p>
            <p>
                China’s film industry is producing more high-quality movies that resonate with domestic audiences. The
                country’s top two films last year highlight the diversity of offerings: “Full River Red,” a
                dialogue-rich suspense thriller, and “The Wandering Earth II,” a science-fiction blockbuster heavy with
                special effects.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over the last year, studio executives have decclassed that the demand for American films in China, at
                least for now, has changed so drastically that movie budgets must be recalibrated. Franchise sequels
                must be made for less money because China can no longer be counted on for the same level of revenue,
                even though the number of movie theater screens has quadrupled over the last decade.

                Hannah Li, 27, works at a technology company in Beijing. She used to watch only foreign films, she
                saclass, but that has changed recently. She saclass her favorite film last year was “The Wandering Earth
                II,” a story about how the world came together to save Earth from being engulfed by the sun. The film’s
                message, Ms. Li saclass, promotes a type of collectivism that she rarely sees in Hollywood movies — and
                should send a signal to American producers. “If you don’t want to get off your high horse to see what we
                like, then it’s natural that you will be washed-out,” Ms. Li saclass. “Hollywood movies can no longer
                bring novelty to Chinese audiences.”

                When we walk and use a phone at the same time, Dr. Giang saclass, we reflexively adjust how we move.
                Vclasseo footage of pedestrians has shown that people on phones walk about 10 percent slower than their
                undistracted counterparts. “You see a number of gait changes that reflect slowing down,” saclass Patrick
                Crowley, a project manager at the Technical University of Denmark who has studied the biomechanics of
                walking while using a phone. “People take shorter steps and spend longer time with both feet on the
                ground.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Looking down at a smartphone while walking — as opposed to standing up straight — can also increase the
                amount of load, or force, placed on the neck and upper back muscles, which can contribute to symptoms of
                “text neck.” And research in the journal Gait & Posture suggests all this could reduce balance and
                increase the risk of stumbles or falls.
            </p>
            <p>
                When scientists want to study stress, they often ask people to perform several tasks at once. That’s
                because multitasking is a reliable way to stress people out. There’s evclassence that walking while
                using a phone functions this way too, even if we’re not aware of it in the moment. One experiment found
                that the more people used a phone while walking on a treadmill, the more their levels of cortisol, the
                so-called stress hormone, tended to rise.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dr. Giang’s work has looked at the connection between “phone-related distracted walking” and emergency
                department visits. Using government data spanning the years 2011 to 2019, he and his colleagues turned
                up nearly 30,000 walking injuries occasioned by phones. While many of those accclassents occurred on
                streets and sclassewalks, almost a quarter happened at home. Tripping over something or falling down the
                stairs is a real risk, Dr. Giang saclass.
            </p>
            <p>
                Age was one of the major risk factors for phone-related walking injuries, his study found. Young people
                from the ages of 11 to 20 had the highest proportion of injuries, followed by adults in their 20s, 30s
                and 40s — perhaps because younger people use their phones more than older people do, he saclass.

                Gummy supplements are a relatively new phenomenon, but gummy candies are not. Only in the late 1990s and
                early 2000s, though, dclass the supplement industry begin experimenting with gummies. The driving
                principle was not a new one: As Mary Poppins put it, “A spoonful of sugar makes the medicine go down.”
                Flintstones multivitamins have been around in their hard, chewable form since 1968; even if superior to
                pills, they basically taste like sweet, vaguely chemical chalk.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now gummy supplements are everywhere. They’re a rapclassly expanding $7 billion–plus industry, and by
                2027 that figure is projected to double. But what makes gummy supplements appealing also makes them
                concerning. The reason they taste as good as candy, it turns out, is because on average, they can
                contain just as much sugar as candy does. The earliest gummy supplements, Cooperman told me, were
                basically just candy with vitamins sprayed on.
            </p>
            <p>
                They’ve come a long way since then: The active ingredients are now carefully integrated into the gummy
                itself by scientists such as Puch, and done so in a way that preserves as much of the gummy’s flavor and
                consistency as possible. But the nutritional essentials haven’t changed much—the average gummy vitamin
                contains about the same amount of sugar in a serving as one Sour Patch Kclass does.
            </p>
            <p>
                Annual calls to Poison Control for pediatric melatonin overdoses have risen 530 percent over the past
                decade, in part, experts suggested to me last year, because of the hormone’s increased availability in
                gummy form. The overdose numbers are also up for multivitamins.
            </p>
            <p>
                The risk of overdose can be greatly mitigated by simply taking care to store gummies where kclasss can’t
                get them. The more significant problem, Cooperman told me, is that gummies are simply a less reliable
                delivery mechanism than the alternatives. Vitamins and many other compounds degrade far faster in
                gummies’ half-liquclass, half-solclass state than in traditional pill or capsule form, he saclass,
                because gummies offer less protection from heat, light, moisture, and other contaminants.

                Chayka is a staff writer at the New Yorker and he is concerned about the effect of the Filterworld, his
                word for the 'network of algorithms that influence our lives today, which has had a particularly
                dramatic impact on culture and the ways it is distributed and consumed'.
            </p>
            <p>
                He is referring to the songs Spotify cues up, the films Netflix suggests, the stories Facebook feeds its
                users, the broken flush of TikTok videos. They all use algorithms which calculate what grabs our
                attention and give us more of it, neglecting the ‘veggies’ of more nourishing content. We are Homer
                Simpson in hell, hooked up to the endless doughnuts machine – and, like Homer, we lap it up.
            </p>
            <p>
                From an audience perspective, the fear is that we will end up in a place of shallow, short-term
                satisfaction, culturally fulfilled. Chayka also worries about the impact on creators, who might be
                encouraged to converge on what pleases the algorithms. The combined result, he says, is the ‘pervasive
                flattening’ of culture: ‘By flatness I mean homogenisation, but also a reduction into simplicity: the
                least ambiguous, least disruptive and perhaps least meaningful pieces of culture are promoted the most.’
            </p>
            <p>
                He uses 'the generic coffee shop' as an example, describing his visits to Kyoto, Berlin, Beijing and
                Reykjavík, where his phone directed him to independent coffee shops that were all the same, despite no

                That might be true: Chayka is the expert. But to a non-American it seems to be exactly globalisation,
                specifically Americanisation, an acceleration of the cultural hegemony many of us were used to long
                before Filterworld’s algorithms. Global platforms have enabled American culture to spread more quickly,
                New York’s trends followed minute to minute by people in Sheffield or Tokyo or Reykjavik, but those
                trends spread before the internet. The algorithms might be a better mallet, but it is still America
                flattening global culture.

                Low fertility has become a national emergency in South Korea, where experts say that if the decline
                continues, the nation’s population could shrink by two-thirds by the end of the century. Korean
                newspapers are filled with stories about closing nursery schools, expanded baby bonuses and whether it
                will become necessary to conscript women into the armed forces to meet quotas. If fertility in South
                Korea can fall so far, it’s “plausible,” Pomeroy said, to think that it might happen in other countries,
                including the United States, where the total fertility rate is still a bit above 1.6. The U.S.
                population is still growing slowly, mainly because of immigration.
            </p>
            <p>
                What makes a baby bust so hard to fight is that its effects compound over the generations. Fewer births
                in one generation lead to fewer women in the next generation to give birth. A smaller population may put
                less stress on the environment, but an upside-down population pyramid leaves too few working young
                people to support the retired elderly.
            </p>
            <p>
                The politically preferred solution to a low birthrate is simply to raise the rate. But pronatalist
                policies such as bonuses for having babies, free child care and so on haven’t met expectations where
                they’ve been tried. If policymakers can’t get birthrates up, they will be left with an unappetizing set
                of choices: raise taxes, raise the retirement age, cut retirement and health care benefits for older
                adults or increase immigration.
            </p>
            <p>
                That last option, increasing immigration, has a lot going for it. It can benefit both the receiving
                nation and the sending nation. People who go abroad to work send remittances home. They may also bring
                back ideas for new businesses. The Philippines has a small but growing start-up culture that seems to
                have been energized by Filipinos who worked abroad, Pomeroy said.
            </p>
            <p>
                The challenge for rich nations with low birthrates is to integrate new arrivals both economically and
                socially. That requires the public’s support for investment in housing, education and other things
                immigrants need. In the United States, a nation of immigrants, support for immigration remains fairly
                strong despite the chaos on the southern border.

            <p>
                At last year’s COP28 climate summit in Dubai, the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
                presented a stark warning. The world remains on track for at least three degrees Celsius of global
                warming by the end of the century and, with it, the threat of massive social and political upheaval. To
                avert this looming catastrophe, countries must accelerate the transition to net-zero carbon energy and
                the decarbonization of their economies.
            </p>
            <p>
                Such a transition is within reach in engineering terms, but it remains politically and economically
                difficult. Some observers insist that it will only come with stiff costs. During last fall's strike in
                the United States by the United Autoworkers' Union (UAW)—when employees at the “big three” car makers
                forced management to cave to most of their demands—many analysts framed the dispute as one that in
                effect pitted the green economy against workers.
            </p>
            <p>
                U.S. auto companies had created a production system for electric vehicles built around low-wage,
                nonunion jobs; in the process, they set up a seemingly existential choice between decarbonization on the
                one hand and good jobs for manufacturing workers on the other. The union, many observers insisted, was
                not keeping up with the times; its imperatives were at odds with the realities of the transition to
                clean energy.
            </p>
            <p>
                But that frame profoundly misunderstood both the strike and the challenge of tackling climate change.
                The resolution of the UAW strike shows why a successful clean energy transition must be a just one that
                strengthens the rights of workers and gives the needs of all the stakeholders in the economy their due.
                The strike cut through the false binary presented by its critics. The union forced the inclusion of the
                production of electric vehicles and their batteries in the new, improved autoworker contracts—showing
                that the decarbonization of the auto industry can still create good jobs.
            </p>
            <p>
                The workers' demand to be fully included in the green transition in the auto industry is a call for a
                revival of the system that prevailed in World War II, when government investment was effectively
                combined with private initiatives, strong labor standards, and direct union involvement. Indeed, it was
                the UAW under its first president, Walter Reuther, that pioneered this strategy in the days after Pearl
                Harbor, forcing a much more rapid conversion to war production than the auto companies had said was
                possible. It is this speed and scale—driven by a new kind of relationship between firms, workers, and
                the state—that will be needed if the planet is to avoid ruin.

            <p>
                The UAW strike challenged the model of financialized shareholder capitalism that holds sway today. That
                prevailing economic system has failed to respond effectively either to the threat of climate change or
                to the needs of workers. Since the 1970s, the global economy has been dominated by a form of capitalism
                in which power within firms is overwhelmingly held by shareholders, the management of firms responds to
                shareholder-oriented financial metrics, and the allocation of capital is the province of largely
                unregulated financial markets dominated by short-term investors.
            </p>
            <p>
                This kind of capitalism emerged in the 1980s, championed by leaders such as British Prime Minister
                Margaret Thatcher and U.S President Ronald Reagan, and became mainstreamed in business schools and
                idolized by politicians, academics, and business leaders in the years following the collapse of the
                Soviet Union. It encourages stock buybacks and treats workers as a cost rather than an asset: businesses
                focus on quarterly returns and reward their shareholders but not the workers, who are central to
                creating value.
            </p>
            <p>
                The reality is that this shareholder capitalism—which has resulted in $6.3 trillion in share buybacks
                over the last decade that aim to boost stock prices, stock options, and executive pay—will not be able
                to steer the investment needed to fight against climate change. Instead, countries must build structures
                of cooperation and mutual benefit between firms, workers, and government. Stakeholder capitalism, in
                contrast with shareholder capitalism, requires that public support for private firms have strong
                conditionality: clear goals to which businesses are held accountable; high labor, social, and
                environmental standards; and profit sharing with the public.
            </p>
            <p>
                Stakeholder capitalism is defined by a balance of power among an economy’s stakeholders: notably its
                firms, workers, and government. The institutional mechanisms that order these relationships have varied
                and will continue to vary across different countries with different histories. And the ways states shape
                markets and interact with firms vary even more widely. But what characterizes this alternative to
                financialized shareholder capitalism is the insistence that workers be included in the governance of the
                firm and that any benefits to companies are conditional on them making investments that are good for
                people and the planet.
            </p>
            <p>
                Stakeholder capitalism does not mean the end of private ownership of firms, nor does it abandon the idea
                of the firm as a profit-making entity. Instead, it seeks to shape how corporations are governed, what
                their incentives and constraints are, and how they fit into the wider picture of societal governance as
                they pursue their mission of long-term profit generation. It does mean that shareholders—who retain in
                all the world’s significant economies a disproportionate role in the governance of private firms—have to
                act as stewards for the firm in the context of markets actively shaped by states in the service of the
                common good.

                The numbers say it all: cities are hugely important to the world’s future but face big challenges. More
                than half of the world’s nearly eight billion people live in a city. Of those, 2.8 billion — the
                combined population of China and India — lack proper housing. For more than one billion individuals,
                home is in an informal settlement, and that number is rising. Some 90% live in Africa or Asia, according
                to 2020 data.
            </p>
            <p>
                What's more, few, if any, of the targets of the 11th United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG
                11) to “make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable” are even within
                shouting distance of being achieved by the 2030 deadline . Some progress has been made in expanding
                access to public transport (currently available to around half of the world’s urban dwellers). However,
                “vast gaps” remain when it comes to achieving universal access to affordable homes, improving living
                conditions and reducing the environmental impact of cities, says the urban-development agency
                UN-Habitat.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are gaps, too, when it comes to cities and science. Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) need
                the kind of knowledge-based decision-making that is routine in high-income countries. And yet most
                research expertise is concentrated in rich nations, notes Eduardo Cesar Leão Marques, a political
                scientist at the University of São Paulo, Brazil, in a review article in the inaugural edition of Nature
                Cities.
            </p>
            <p>
                This, in turn, makes it harder for researchers in LMICs to publish their research on regions such as
                Latin America in journals based in the United States, says María José Álvarez-Rivadulla, a sociologist
                at the University of the Andes in Bogotá who has worked on cities in both areas. This is at least in
                part because reviewers don’t see such articles as relevant to readers who are based mainly in
                high-income countries. “You have to keep justifying why you study the cities that you study, because
                they are not in the global north and your research isn’t based in a rich university in a rich country,”
                she says.
            </p>
            <p>
                A second, related, problem is that most existing research in, on or about cities falls in disciplines
                that don’t focus exclusively on urban environments. Studies on governance, climate and sustainability,
                public health, transport and other topics relevant to cities can be found in publications, including the
                Nature Portfolio journals, that serve their respective communities. But there are few journals that
                speak to all those working in the urban space and consider urban challenges across social divides.

        <div class="paragraph-content">
            <p>
                Dragons are a big deal in Chinese culture. Whereas in the West dragons are often depicted as winged,
                fire-breathing monsters, the Chinese dragon, or the loong, is a symbol of strength and magnanimity. The
                mythical being is so revered that it snagged a spot as the only fictional creature in the Chinese
                Zodiac’s divine roster. And the imagery pervades society today—whether in boats, dances, or the stars.
            </p>
            <p>
                Where the Chinese dragon first came from is still debated by historians and archaeologists. But one of
                the most ancient images of the loong was unearthed in a tomb in 1987 in Puyang, Henan: a two-meter-long
                statue dating back to the Neolithic civilization of Yangshao Culture some 5,000–7,500 years ago.
                Meanwhile, Hongshan Culture’s Jade Dragon—a C-shaped carving with a snout, mane, and thin eyes—could be
                traced back to Inner Mongolia five millennia back.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nothing cemented the Chinese dragon’s might better than when it became a symbol of the empire. The
                mythical Yellow Emperor, a legendary sovereign, is said to have been fetched by a Chinese dragon to head
                to the afterlife. The loong are also said to have literally fathered emperors, or at least that’s what
                Liu Bang, the first emperor of the Han dynasty (202-195 B.C.), made his subjects believe: that he was
                born after his mother consorted with a Chinese dragon.
            </p>
            <p>
                From then on, the loong was a recurrent theme across dynasties. The seat of the emperor was called the
                Dragon Throne, and every emperor was called “the true Dragon as the Son of Heaven.” D. C. Zhang, a
                researcher in the Institute of Oriental Studies at the Slovak Academy of Sciences in Bratislava, tells
                TIME that later dynasties even prohibited commoners from using any Chinese dragon motif on their clothes
                if they weren’t part of the imperial family.
            </p>

                The Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) created the first iteration of a Chinese national flag featuring a dragon
                with a red pearl, which was to be hung on Navy ships. But as the Qing Dynasty weakened after several
                notable military losses, including the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895) and Boxer Rebellion of 1900,
                caricatures of the dragon began to be used as a form to protest against the government for its weakness,
                says Zhang.

            <p>
                Modern research confirms that personality is malleable. Across the population, personality changes in a
                healthier direction over time. In other words, as people age, they tend to experience fewer negative
                emotions and more positive ones, are more conscientious, place greater emphasis on positive
                relationships, and are less judgmental of others. Importantly, there is a lot of variability here—some
                people change a great deal and others remain relatively stable.
            </p>
            <p>
                Is it possible to speed up these gradually unfolding positive changes? In my research conducting
                clinical trials to test the effect of cognitive behavioral therapy on personality traits, we find that
                meaningful, lasting change can occur over the course of just 12 weeks. Moreover, in a large
                meta-analysis(basically, a summary of all the studies done in this area) of clinical trials that
                included an assessment of personality, the Big Five traits changed significantly, with the greatest
                improvement occurring early in treatment(within eight weeks) and in response to cognitive behavioral
                therapy.
            </p>
            <p>
                The good news is that cognitive-behavioral techniques are relatively simple, and they don’t necessarily
                require the help of a therapist. The first component involves changing your thinking patterns (this is
                the “cognitive” piece). You have to become aware of your thoughts to determine whether they’re keeping
                you stuck acting in line with a particular trait. For example, if you find yourself thinking that
                “people are only looking out for themselves,” you are likely to behave defensively around others.
            </p>
            <p>
                The behavioral component involves becoming aware of your current action tendencies and testing out new
                responses. If you are defensive around other people, they will probably respond negatively to you (e.g.,
                withdrawing, snapping at you), confirming your belief that you can’t trust others. By contrast, if you
                try behaving more openly (perhaps sharing that you’re struggling with a task with a co-worker), you have
                the opportunity to see if that changes the way others act toward you. By taking small, manageable steps
                (i.e., changing your behavior) and shifting how you think about yourself (i.e., changing your thoughts),
                you can start an upward trajectory that ends in lasting personality change.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first step is to identify a meaningful relationship, career, or personal life goal. For example, I
                hope to someday be in a leadership role at my university. Then, think about the traits or
                characteristics that make success more likely in this area. University leaders are often diplomatic and
                measured, where as I tend to wear my heart on my sleeve and have a hard time keeping my opinions to
                myself in meetings.
            </p>
            <p>
                What is a small behavioral change you could make that would be more in line with the desired
                trait—something that would take you out of your comfort zone a little bit, but still feels manageable?
                For my goal, I might try holding my tongue during faculty meetings until at least three people have
                expressed their opinions. I might learn from that experience that other people may have the same
                concerns and I don't always have to be the one to go out on a limb. This is an example of small changes
                to my behavior and thoughts that, if maintained over time, can be the first step on the journey of
                personality change.

        <div class="paragraph-content">
            <p>
                High-temperature superconductivity is one of the holy grails of physics. It also seems to attract a
                steady stream of controversy, with a recent string of retracted papers and provocative claims that
                haven’t held up to scrutiny.
            </p>
            <p>
                Superconductivity is the name physicists give to an unusual phenomenon in which a material is able to
                conduct electricity with no resistance. While the effect has been known for more than a century, so far
                superconductivity has only been found to occur at incredibly low temperatures. And in the few cases
                where it’s been achieved at anything approaching the balminess of a winter’s day in Antarctica, it’s
                required mind-bogglingly high pressure comparable to the pressure deep in the Earth’s core.
            </p>
            <p>
                The stakes are enormous: If superconductors worked at anything close to room temperature, it could lead
                to everything from levitating trains and improved MRI scanners to better energy storage devices and more
                efficient electronics in general. Perhaps because of that potential, the field has spawned a great deal
                of hype, often accompanied by disappointment.
            </p>
            <p>
                Could some of the controversy be avoided if scientists were more open in terms of making their methods
                and data available for scrutiny? I think there are a few reasons why there is controversy. First of all,
                making sure that you are reporting something that is a superconductor and not just a metal with strange
                properties, can in some cases be very difficult. So in the case of the hydrides, for example, it was
                really hard to show that they do indeed expel a magnetic field — that they exhibit what is known as the
                Meissner Effect—just because of the way that the experiments are performed in diamond anvil cells that
                have a lot of magnetic material. So it’s just experimentally difficult, in that case, to actually 100
                percent prove that what you have is a superconductor.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course, there are other issues about reporting all data and making sure that researchers have access
                to it. But, there are issues about fraud, and then there are issues about not being able to prove
                something 100 percent correctly at that given time because of experimental limitations, which are two
                separate issues.

                An Instagram-worthy ombré bubble tea may not seem like the most British of beverages, compared to a cup
                of Earl Grey during elevenses. Yet Taiwan region's boba tea, known for its chewy tapioca pearls and
                endless customisation options, has become increasingly ubiquitous in the UK. The country is certainly
                not the first to cash in on this market, but it's found an even bigger opportunity amid a shifting
                demographic and changing consumer base.
            </p>
            <p>
                Served hot or cold, bubble tea is typically a sweetened fruity or milky tea – always shaken, never
                stirred – with starchy tapioca balls slurped through a jumbo straw. Originating in Taiwan region in the
                1980s, bubble tea started spreading as stalls blossomed across Hong Kong, China’s mainland and the US,
                gaining popularity among Taiwan residents communities in California in the 90s.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the UK, boba shops seem to be sprouting up overnight around busy tube stations, trendy high streets
                and at university cafés. Franchises including Gong cha, Bubbleology, Mooboo and T4 are rapidly
                multiplying. Long lines of enthusiastic customers attest to the popularity of the drink, with people
                posting on social media about enjoying #BobaTime – on TikTok, #BubbleTea tops 8.3 billion views.
            </p>
            <p>
                Justin Goes, development director for UK and Ireland at the tea franchise Gong cha, which is planning to
                open 500 new stores in Britain, believes "bubble tea is one of the most exciting segments of the UK’s F
                and B [food and beverage] industry", especially as the demand for "east-to-west food and beverage spikes
                in the UK". The beverage addresses what Goes calls an "explosion" in broad consumer demand, but its
                appeal and growth is specifically bolstered by young consumers with new purchasing power – and specific
                preferences.
            </p>
            <p>
                That bubble tea lends itself so well to the endless customisation and bold flavours Gen Z prefers is
                part of the reason it's so popular, explains McCoy-Ward, known on social media platforms as Bubble Tea
                Kristin. The beverage feeds into frenzied FOMO and the desire to get in on the biggest, quirkiest and
                prettiest new trend. Muslim customers, says McCoy-Ward, have also taken up bubble tea as a treat of
                choice, as it's "perfect for people who can't drink alcohol and don't want coffee". In England and
                Wales, Muslims make up 6.5% of the population, and are also one of the youngest groups.

                Appeals to common sense are a staple of politics, especially when an insurgent wishes to distinguish
                himself from a supposedly aloof and out-of-touch elite. But in a paper published in Proceedings of the
                National Academy of Sciences, Mark Whiting and Duncan Watts, a pair of computational social scientists
                at the University of Pennsylvania, note that the idea has seldom been rigorously studied. The two
                researchers set out to fix that. They started by noting that the standard concept of common sense has a
                somewhat circular definition: common sense is a set of claims that sensible people agree with, and
                sensible people are those who possess common sense.
            </p>
            <p>
                To get around such philosophical tangles, the researchers turned to Mechanical Turk, a website run by
                Amazon, a big tech firm, that allows people to post odd jobs. They recruited 2,046 human participants
                and asked them to rate 50 statements from a corpus of 4,407 claims that might plausibly be seen as
                commonsensical.
            </p>
            <p>
                As common sense might have predicted, the researchers found that plainly worded claims concerning facts
                about the real world were the most likely to be rated as demonstrating common sense (“triangles have
                three sides”, for example, which is true by definition, or “avoid close contact with people who are
                ill”). The more abstract the claims, the less likely participants were to agree that they were common
                sense (“all human beings are created equal”; “perception is the only source of knowledge”).
            </p>
            <p>
                When they split the claims by subject, the researchers found that those concerning technology and
                science were the most likely to be rated as commonsensical, while matters of history and philosophy were
                the least likely. A respondent’s age, sex, income and personal politics had little effect on what they
                thought counted as common sense, although psychological measures of social perceptiveness and the
                ability to reflect on one’s opinions did.
            </p>
            <p>
                Having investigated individual opinions, the researchers looked at how common sense works across big
                groups. Here, they found much less agreement than might have been expected. Only around 44% of claims in
                the corpus were rated as commonsensical by at least 75% of respondents. A stricter definition of common
                sense, in which everyone has to agree with a claim for it to count, cut that number to just 6.6%. Where
                exactly a sensible cut-off lies is a matter for debate. But truly “common” sense, it seems, is an
                elusive thing.

                Move along, not much to see here. That seemed to be the message from OpenAI last week, about an
                experiment to see whether its advanced AI chatbot GPT-4 could help science-savvy individuals make and
                release a biological weapon.
            </p>
            <p>
                The chatbot “provided at most a mild uplift” to those efforts, OpenAI announced, though it added that
                more work on the subject was urgently needed. Headlines reprised the comforting conclusion that the
                large language model was not a terrorist’s cookbook.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dig deeper into the research, however, and things look a little less reassuring. At almost every stage
                of the imagined process, from sourcing a biological agent to scaling it up and releasing it,
                participants armed with GPT-4 were able to inch closer to their villainous goal than rivals using the
                internet alone.
            </p>
            <p>
                The chief takeaway from the exercise should not be a sense of relief. “[Open AI] ought to be pretty
                worried by these results,” wrote Gary Marcus, a commentator who has testified on AI oversight before a
                US Senate committee, last week in his widely read newsletter.

                So should we. We need better independent mechanisms for realistically assessing and curbing such
                threats. Just as we do not permit drug companies to rule on the safety of medicines, AI risk evaluation
                cannot be left to the industry alone.

                Ten times a second an object shaped like a thick pizza box and holding a silicon wafertakes off three
                times faster than a manned rocket. For a few milliseconds it moves at a constant speed before being
                halted abruptly with astonishing precision—within a single atom of its target. This is not a high-energy
                physics experiment. It is the latest lithography machine dreamed up by ASML, a manufacturer of
                chipmaking tools, to project nanoscopic chip patterns onto silicon wafers. On January 5th Intel, an
                American semiconductor giant, became the first proud owner of this technical marvel’s initial components
                for assembly at its factory in Oregon.
            </p>
            <p>
                Like the outwardly unassuming machine, its Dutch maker is full of surprises. The company’s market value
                has quadrupled in the past five years, to €260bn ($285bn), making it Europe’s most valuable technology
                firm. Between 2012 and 2022 its sales and net profit both rose roughly four-fold, to €21bn and €6bn,
                respectively. In late 2023 ASML’s operating margin exceeded 34%, staggering for a hardware business and
                more than that of Apple, the world’s biggest maker of consumer electronics.
            </p>
            <p>
                Such stellar performance, which is set to shine brightly again when ASML reports quarterly results on
                January 24th, is now routine. The firm holds a monopoly on a key link in the world’s most critical
                supply chain: without its kit it is next to impossible to make cutting-edge chips that go into
                smartphones and data centres where artificial intelligence (AI) is trained. With global semiconductor
                sales forecast to double to $1.3trn by 2032, every big country and every big chipmaker wants ASML’s
                gear. The company has become so important in the Sino-American techno-tussle that, as it recently
                emerged, America’s government pressed ASML to cancel planned deliveries of even its older machines to
                China.
            </p>
            <p>
                Yet ASML’s spectacular success is also underpinned by two other, less obvious factors. The company has
                created a network of suppliers and technology partners that may be the closest thing Europe has to
                Silicon Valley. And its business model ingeniously combines hardware with software and data. These
                unsung elements of ASML’s success challenge the notion that the old continent is incapable of developing
                a successful digital platform.
            </p>
            <p>
                ASML’s complex machines perform a simple task. They project chip blueprints onto photosensitive silicon
                wafers. In 1986, when its first model was delivered, individual transistors measured micrometres and its
                kit was almost like a glorified photocopier, explains Marc Hijink, a Dutch journalist and author of
                “Focus—How ASML Conquered the Chip World”, a new book. Today, with transistors shrunk by a factor of a
                thousand, ASML lithography gear is possibly the most sophisticated equipment ever sold commercially.

                More than half of British girls do not feel confident learning maths while two-fifths feel insecure
                about science, according to a report which highlights an “alarming” gender confidence gap in schools.
                Research by the education charity Teach First found that 54% of girls lacked confidence in maths,
                compared with 41% of boys, but the gap was even wider in science, where 43% of girls lacked confidence
                compared with 26% of boys.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite feeling less confident, girls often outperform boys in Stem (science, technology, engineering
                and mathematics) subjects at GCSE, with a higher percentage achieving top grades – though fewer girls
                then take these subjects at A-level and go on into Stem careers. The results have prompted warnings that
                poor gender diversity will exacerbate the skills shortage currently facing the Stem sector, and Teach
                First is calling for more high-quality, specialist teachers to help inspire the next generation into
                these fields.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2020, women made up less than 30% of the UK Stem workforce, while the Institution of Engineering and
                Technology (IET) has warned of a shortfall of more than 173,000 workers – the equivalent of 10 unfilled
                roles per business,on average.
            </p>
            <p>
                Teach First, which trains high-quality graduates to teach in schools in challenging areas, is calling
                for an increase in pay for trainee teachers to incentivise Stem professionals into teaching in order to
                alleviate some of the shortages. Many schools are struggling to recruit teachers, particularly for
                maths, computing and physics.
            </p>
            <p>
                Teach First’s chief impact officer, Amy Mitchell, said: “It’s deeply troubling that too few children
                feel confident studying science and maths, with too many girls in particular left behind. “Girls are
                just as capable as boys when it comes to maths and science, but this confidence gap poses a huge threat
                to the UK’s future, with Stem skills desperately needed to boost economic growth and to help tackle the
                major problems we face such as climate change.”

                Think: Lifetime movie cut up into TikTok videos. Think: soap opera, but for the short attention span of
                the internet age. The biggest player in this new genre is ReelShort, an app that offers melodramatic
                content in minute-long, vertically shot episodes and is hoping to bring a successful formula established
                abroad to the United States by hooking millions of people on its short-form content.
            </p>
            <p>
                ReelShort’s titles include “The Double Life of My Billionaire Husband,” “I Got Married Without You” and
                “Bound by Vendetta: Sleeping With the Enemy.” The shows are formulaic: The plotlines include romance and
                revenge, the characters are archetypical and the dialogues are simple. ReelShort aims to get people
                hooked as quickly as possible, with much of the action happening in the first few super short episodes.
                “This is a pay-as-you-go model,” Mr. Jia said. “If people are confused by the story, they leave.”
            </p>
            <p>
                The cost of making these features is relatively low, $300,000 or less, according to Crazy Maple Studios.
                The crews are small and partly made up of recent film graduates in Los Angeles, according to actors who
                worked on the productions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Viewers can watch dozens of minute-long episodes on ReelShort for free via multiple platforms, including
                YouTube and TikTok. But at some point, they must either pay or watch ads to unlock subsequent episodes.
                Sometimes people pay as much as $10 or $20 to keep watching, Ms. Zhang, the producer, said.
                “Isn’t that a crazy business?”
            </p>
            <p>
                Last month, ReelShort was downloaded one million times and earned $5 million in revenue in Apple’s app
                store, according to the data firm Sensor Tower, and it was downloaded three million times in the Google
                Play Store, earning $3 million in revenue there. Since November, ReelShort has ranked somewhere in the
                top 15 of most popular entertainment apps in both app stores on most days. (For a few days in November,
                ReelShort even surpassed TikTok as the most popular entertainment app in Apple’s app store.)

                In late summer, Death Valley National Park earns its name. The heat in this region of California and
                Nevada is relentless. Record temperatures are set, and the air is often bone dry. Despite the heat and
                aridity, there was a slow but steady drip of water into the collection vial of Omar Yaghi’s device, an
                assembly of components loosely resembling a telescope. By the end of the day, this system had collected
                only a few millilitres of water — barely enough for a refreshing sip. But these results, published in
                July, nevertheless represent a landmark in the field of atmospheric water harvesting (AWH).
            </p>
            <p>
                Given the extremity of the testing conditions, the results suggest that the key ingredient in this
                device — a water-absorbing compound called MOF-303 — has the potential to deliver life-sustaining
                volumes of clean water to regions that currently struggle to access it. “The vision there is to have
                something like a village-scale device,” says Yaghi, a chemist at the University of California, Berkeley.
                “If you’ve got a tonne of MOF-303, you could deliver about 500 litres of water a day, every day for five
                to six years.”
            </p>
            <p>
                By current estimates, roughly two billion people lack access to clean drinking water. Desalinated
                seawater can meet some of this need, but the technology required remains costly and is limited to
                communities with coastal access. This explains the growing enthusiasm for alternative solutions that
                extract clean water from the air. The US Geological Survey estimates that Earth’s atmosphere contains
                nearly 13,000 cubic kilometres of water — more than six times the volume of the world’s rivers.
            </p>
            <p>
                “You cannot deplete it — it’s always replenished by natural evaporation from a larger water body,” says
                Tian Li, a materials scientist at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana. And although many of the
                most promising AWH technologies are still at the stage of lab demonstrations or proof-of-concept
                devices, the field is quickly building momentum towards real-world systems that produce plentiful
                amounts of water at low cost.
            </p>
            <p>
                Systems that condense water from ambient air offer a more generally useful solution. Several companies
                have already developed electrically powered ‘active’ AWH machines for this purpose. In most cases,
                these use fans to draw warm, moisture-bearing air into an apparatus that directly cools the air and
                collects the resulting water condensate; in some cases, this water is also subject to filtration and
                additional treatment. These systems can produce considerable volumes.

                Women are up to four times more likely than men to be affected by autoimmune disease, conditions in
                which the immune system mistakenly attacks the body's own cells. Now, scientists think they know why:
                Women's outsized risk may be tied to how the body controls its X chromosomes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Humans have two types of sex chromosomes: X and Y. Most females carry two X chromosomes in each cell,
                while most males have an X and a Y. The X chromosome is larger than the Y and contains far more genes
                that code for proteins. But in people with two X chromosomes, only one needs to participate in protein
                production — otherwise, cells could soon be overwhelmed with too many proteins. To prevent this,
                one X chromosome in each cell is "silenced" in females during embryonic development.
            </p>
            <p>
                A long molecule of RNA — the genetic cousin of DNA — called Xist executes this silencing by latching
                onto one X chromosome. It turns out, however, that many proteins are prone to sticking to Xist, and
                these big complexes of RNA and proteins may predispose females to autoimmune disease.</p>
            <p>
                That's because the complexes can set off an immune reaction in which the body makes antibodies against
                them proteins within it, according to a new study in mice and humans published Thursday (Feb. 1) in the
                journal Cell.
            </p>
            <p>
                "So besides it's [Xist] job in controlling gene activity, there's really a major immunological imprint
                that maybe hadn't previously been recognized," Dr. Howard Chang, co-senior study author and a professor
                of cancer research and genetics at Stanford University , told Live Science. These findings could
                therefore open up new avenues for research into treatments for autoimmune diseases, he said.

                A bus with passengers crosses London Bridge during the morning rush hour, March 10, 2023. A group of
                academics and transport officials chose 150 London buses and placed stickers on the windows prompting
                passengers to say “hi” and “thank you.”
            </p>
            <p>
                A group of transport officials and academics wanted to see what would happen on city buses across London
                if it put up signs encouraging riders to say “hi” and “thank you” to their drivers. The simple
                experiment bore fruit, bumping positive interactions with drivers by 30% on buses where signs were
                posted. Researchers say these methods could be deployed elsewhere to promote stronger social connection.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Small interactions matter, and they are a bedrock on which you can build,” says Grainne O’Dwyer, senior
                program manager of Neighbourly Lab, a research nonprofit that partnered on the study. “Communities can
                support themselves if they’re more resilient and work together, and feel they have someone to rely on.

                Essential workers from shopkeepers to street sweepers to grocery baggers come across hundreds of people
                on a day-to-day basis. They present huge, untapped potential for connection, says Ms. O’Dwyer. “There’s
                growing evidence that social connection has value,” says Ms. O’Dwyer. “It’s also just a very basic human
                need to say, ‘I feel respected. I feel seen.’ And very simple nudges that you can put in context that
                can have a big, big impact.

                What’s next for behavioral scientists is to figure out what makes such interactions so rare. The “reward
                circuitry” of the brain encourages connection, says Nicholas Epley, a behavioral scientist and
                psychologist at the University of Chicago. “If you feel better saying hi to your bus driver, why don’t
                people do it more?” asks Dr. Epley. Society shapes how one is expected to interact in public. But
                there’s also the fear of the unknown, says Dr.Epley. “Reaching out – it’s a little like going into the
                ocean when there could be sharks. Our brains aren’t very good at handling uncertainty. Even a small dose
                of it can cause us to be reluctant to do things,” he says.

                People with blue eyes can read better in darker conditions than those with brown eyes, a small study has
                found. This suggests having blue eyes is an advantage in low-light conditions, and might help explain
                why the trait evolved in northern Europe. But the finding needs to be confirmed in a larger study.

                basis for this weaker lighting, rather than just a cultural one. To learn more, she and her student
                Faith Erin Cain tested the vision of 40 people of European descent who had either blue or brown eyes.

                There has long been a cultural taboo around layoffs in Silicon Valley, where employers went to great
                pains to woo and pamper talent. Along with stock options, cruise ship-worthy buffets, free shuttle buses
                and on-site dry cleaning, job security was one of the most powerful attractions to tech companies racing
                to hire skilled software engineers.
            </p>
            <p>
                That taboo has now been broken. “The shine of tech jobs is wearing off a bit with these layoffs,” Jeff
                Shulman, professor at the University of Washington Foster School of Business, wrote in an email. Some
                industry leaders have characterized the shift as a return to a purer kind of tech enterprise. As Meta
                Platforms Inc. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg said in an company Q&A quoted in the newsletter
                Command Line, he doesn’t want to have “managers managing managers, managing managers, managing managers,
                managing the people who are doing the work.” He wants more people pounding Monster energy drinks and
                shipping code and fewer of them “checking in” with colleagues and setting up Zoom calls.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, there’s another interpretation: The industry is just becoming more like the rest of the
                economy.
                During the pandemic, tech seemed to inhabit its own reality. While other businesses struggled as global
                supply chains fragmented and people were trapped at home, the industry boomed. Profits were fat, and
                companies furiously hired engineers, project managers and software salespeople to try to keep up with
                demand. Tech CEOs proclaimed the world had entered a new era—not only of remote work, but of
                tech-centered virtual human interaction.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the industry, says Tim Herbert, chief research officer at CompTIA, “historically there have been
                periodic pendulum swings between ‘all in’ on innovation to ‘all in’ on business fundamentals.” With
                plans to change the world and easy access to cheap capital, Silicon Valley companies have a reputation
                for spending big to develop technologies and lock in customers without regard for short-term profits.
            </p>
            <p>
                The job cuts are a sign that things are now swinging the other way. Growth at tech companies has slowed,
                and higher interest rates have choked off much of the money that for years fed startups, even as the
                broader economy continues to expand at a healthy clip. And so Silicon Valley is settling into a pattern
                familiar in many industries: Companies hire when times are good, let people go when they’re not—and
                sometimes let people go even when they’re not so bad.

                Here are some fun facts with which to woo your date this Valentine’s Day: the event is believed to date
                back to lusty fertility rituals in ancient Rome; Iran banned any celebration of Valentine’s Day in 2011,
                lest it spread promiscuous Western behaviour; and it is one of America’s most lucrative festivals. The
                National Retail Federation (nrf) predicts that the average American will spend $186 on their Valentine
                this year.
            </p>
            <p>
                That total will stretch much further in some cities than others. Using data from the latest
                cost-of-living index by eiu, our sister company, we created our own “cost-of-loving index”. It ranks the
                world’s most expensive cities in which to go on a romantic night out: we start with drinks at a swanky
                hotel, followed by a lavish two-course meal and a trip to the cinema, a taxi home and a nice bottle of
                wine to cap things off.
            </p>
            <p>
                So add to your list of fun facts that couples in Shanghai spend the most on a date night, according to
                eiu’s data. Residents there might expect to blow roughly $600 on our fancy evening (or exactly $298 each
                if they’re going Dutch). In Damascus, the world’s cheapest city, our date would cost less than $8. Paris
                is the most expensive city in Europe; New York the priciest in North America. At $567, couples in the
                Big Apple would each have to spend around $100 more than the nrf’s forecast spending in order to enjoy
                eiu’s basket of items.
            </p>
            <p>
                These prices have increased over the past five years: the average cost of love in our top 15 cities has
                gone up by 10% since 2019, with prices in Caracas, Venezuela’s inflation-ridden capital, rising by the
                most. All these charming facts should see you through any awkward silences on your big date. (The

                Climate change has never been a core issue at a British general election. At the next one it will be.
                That partly reflects rising salience: since the last ballot in 2019, the environment has risen to become
                one of voters’ bigger concerns, alongside the economy, the National Health Service and immigration. But
                there is also an increasingly acrimonious divide between the two big parties over green policy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Take the Conservatives first. Earlier this month, the government announced that Britain had become the
                first big economy to cut its territorial greenhouse-gas emissions by half since 1990. That sounds
                impressive, and it is. But celebrating past success masks the fact that Britain has done well on the
                easier bits of decarbonisation, such as closing down coal-fired power plants, while failing to develop
                plans for tackling emissions in tougher areas, like home heating and agriculture.
            </p>
            <p>
                Last June the Climate Change Committee, a watchdog, said that, for the government to meet its emissions
                target for 2030, it would need to quadruple the rate of emissions reduction outside the power sector. In
                fact Britain has gone backwards in some areas. In September Rishi Sunak, the prime minister, criticised
                his predecessors for imposing unnecessary costs and delayed a target for banning new gas boilers.
                Electric-vehicle sales have slowed, in part because a ban on the sales of new petrol and diesel cars has
                been deferred.
            </p>
            <p>
                Plans to generate clean energy took a knock when the government’s most recent auction round failed to
                secure any new offshore wind projects. A new nuclear strategy contained a lot of pleasing promises but
                was overshadowed by news of yet another delay at Hinkley Point C, a nuclear-power station being built in
                Somerset.
            </p>
            <p>
                All of which offers plenty of ammunition for other parties to target the Conservatives on the
                environment. Tory MPs in some southern seats already fret about the threat from the Liberal Democrats,
                who are stirring up anger about sewage in rivers. But the climate is also an issue where Mr Sunak spies
                an opportunity to take the fight to Labour, which remains far ahead in the polls. He would like to paint
                the opposition as green radicals who want to kill the oil-and-gas industry, jack up the cost of driving
                and rip out your boiler.
