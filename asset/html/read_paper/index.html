                Neither “Oppenheimer” nor “Barbie,” two of Hollywood’s biggest hits last year, cracked the top 30 in China at the box office, according to Maoyan, a Chinese entertainment data provider that has tracked ticket sales since 2011. The only other recent year when Hollywood was shut out of China’s top 10 was 2020, during the pandemic.
            </p>
            <p>
                Chinese moviegoers who once flocked to Hollywood films have been steadily disappearing. China is, by far, the biggest movie market outside the United States, and a place that American studios rely on for growth and profitability as the film industry struggles.
            </p>
            <p>
                China’s film industry is producing more high-quality movies that resonate with domestic audiences. The country’s top two films last year highlight the diversity of offerings: “Full River Red,” a dialogue-rich suspense thriller, and “The Wandering Earth II,” a science-fiction blockbuster heavy with special effects.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over the last year, studio executives have decided that the demand for American films in China, at least for now, has changed so drastically that movie budgets must be recalibrated. Franchise sequels must be made for less money because China can no longer be counted on for the same level of revenue, even though the number of movie theater screens has quadrupled over the last decade.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hannah Li, 27, works at a technology company in Beijing. She used to watch only foreign films, she said, but that has changed recently. She said her favorite film last year was “The Wandering Earth II,” a story about how the world came together to save Earth from being engulfed by the sun. The film’s message, Ms. Li said, promotes a type of collectivism that she rarely sees in Hollywood movies — and should send a signal to American producers. “If you don’t want to get off your high horse to see what we like, then it’s natural that you will be washed-out,” Ms. Li said. “Hollywood movies can no longer bring novelty to Chinese audiences.”

                When we walk and use a phone at the same time, Dr. Giang said, we reflexively adjust how we move. Video footage of pedestrians has shown that people on phones walk about 10 percent slower than their undistracted counterparts. “You see a number of gait changes that reflect slowing down,” said Patrick Crowley, a project manager at the Technical University of Denmark who has studied the biomechanics of walking while using a phone. “People take shorter steps and spend longer time with both feet on the ground.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Looking down at a smartphone while walking — as opposed to standing up straight — can also increase the amount of load, or force, placed on the neck and upper back muscles, which can contribute to symptoms of “text neck.” And research in the journal Gait & Posture suggests all this could reduce balance and increase the risk of stumbles or falls.
            </p>
            <p>
                When scientists want to study stress, they often ask people to perform several tasks at once. That’s because multitasking is a reliable way to stress people out. There’s evidence that walking while using a phone functions this way too, even if we’re not aware of it in the moment. One experiment found that the more people used a phone while walking on a treadmill, the more their levels of cortisol, the so-called stress hormone, tended to rise.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dr. Giang’s work has looked at the connection between “phone-related distracted walking” and emergency department visits. Using government data spanning the years 2011 to 2019, he and his colleagues turned up nearly 30,000 walking injuries occasioned by phones. While many of those accidents occurred on streets and sidewalks, almost a quarter happened at home. Tripping over something or falling down the stairs is a real risk, Dr. Giang said.
            </p>
            <p>
                Age was one of the major risk factors for phone-related walking injuries, his study found. Young people from the ages of 11 to 20 had the highest proportion of injuries, followed by adults in their 20s, 30s and 40s — perhaps because younger people use their phones more than older people do, he said.
