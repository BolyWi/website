    <p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Thank you!</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
    <p class="s2" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 24pt;text-align: left;">感谢大家！</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
    <p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">I am honored
        to be with you today at your commencement from one of the finest universities in the world. Truth be told, I
        never graduated from college, and this is the closest I&#39;ve ever gotten to a college graduation. Today I want
        to tell you three stories from my life. That&#39;s it. No big deal. Just three stories.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
    <p class="s2" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 24pt;text-align: left;">
        我今天很荣幸能和你们一起参加毕业典礼，斯坦福大学是世界上最好的大学之一。我从来没有从大学中毕业。说实话<span class="p">,</span>今天也许是在我的生命中离大学毕业最近的
        一天了。今天我想向你们讲述我生活中的三个故事。不是什么大不了的事情<span class="p">,</span>只是三个故事而已。</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The first story is about connecting the dots.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
    <p class="s2" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 24pt;text-align: left;">第一个故事是关于如何把生命中的点点滴滴串连起来。</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: justify;">I dropped out of Reed College
        after the first 6 months, but then stayed around as a drop-in for another 18 months or so before I really quit.
        So why did I drop out<span class="s2">？</span></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
    <p class="s2" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 24pt;text-align: left;">我在 <span class="p">Reed
        </span>大学读了六个月之后就退学了<span class="p">,</span>但是在十八个月以后——我真正的作出退学决定之前<span class="p">,</span>我还经常去学校。我为什么要退学呢？</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">It started before I was born.
        My biological mother was a young, unwed college graduate student, and she decided to put me up for adoption. She
        felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college graduates, so everything was all set for me to be adopted
        at birth by a lawyer and his wife. Except that when I popped out they decided at the last minute that they
        really wanted a girl.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
    <p class="s2" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 24pt;text-align: left;">故事从我出生的时候讲起。我的亲生母亲是一个年轻的<span
            class="p">,</span>没有结婚的大学毕业生。她决定让别人收养我<span class="p">,
        </span>她十分想让我被大学毕业生收养。所以在我出生的时候，她已经做好了一切的准备工作，能使得我被一个律师和他的妻子所收养。但是她没有料到<span class="p">,</span>当我出生之后<span
            class="p">, </span>律师夫妇突然决定他们想要一个女孩。</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: justify;">So my parents, who were on a
        waiting list, got a call in the middle of the night asking: &quot;We have an unexpected baby boy; do you want
        him ?&quot; They said: &quot;Of course.&quot; My biological mother later found out that my mother had never 
        graduated from college and that my father had never graduated from high school. She refused to sign the final adoption papers. 
        She only relented a few months later when my parents promised that I would someday go to college.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
    <p class="s2" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 24pt;text-align: justify;">所以我的生养父母<span
            class="p">(</span>他们还在我亲生父母的观察名单上<span class="p">)</span>突然在半夜接到了一个电话<span
            class="p">:</span>“我们现在这儿有一个不小心生出来的男婴<span class="p">,</span>你们想要他吗？”他们回答道<span class="p">:</span>“当然<span
            class="p">!</span>”但是我亲生母亲随后发现，我的养母从来没有上过大学<span class="p">,</span>我的父亲甚至从没有读过高中。她拒绝签这个收养合同。只是在几个月以后<span
            class="p">,</span>我的父母答应她一定要让我上大学<span class="p">,</span>那个时候她才同意。</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">And 17 years later I did go to
        college. But I naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as Stanford, and all of my working-class
        parents&#39; savings were being spent on my college tuition. After six months, I couldn&#39;t see the value in
        it. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out.
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
    <p class="s2" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 24pt;text-align: justify;">在十七岁那年<span
            class="p">,</span>我真的上了大学。但是我很愚蠢的选择了一个几乎和你们斯坦福大学一样贵的学校<span class="p">,
        </span>我父母还处于蓝领阶层，他们几乎把所有积蓄都花在了我的学费上面。在六个月后<span class="p">, </span>我已经看不到其中的价值所在。我不知道我想要在生命中做什么<span
            class="p">,</span>我也不知道大学能帮助我找到怎样的答案。</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">And here I was spending all of
        the money my parents had saved their entire life. So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out
        OK. It was pretty scary at the time, but looking back it was one of the best decisions I ever made. The minute I
        dropped out I could stop taking the required classes that didn&#39;t interest me, and begin dropping in on the
        ones that looked interesting.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
    <p class="s2" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 24pt;text-align: justify;">
        但是在这里，我几乎花光了我父母这一辈子的所有积蓄。所以我决定要退学<span class="p">,</span>我觉得这是个正确的决定。不能否认<span class="p">,</span>我当时确实非常的害怕<span
            class="p">, </span>但是现在回头看看<span class="p">,</span>那的确是我这一生中最棒的一个决定。在我做出退学决定的那一刻<span class="p">,
        </span>我终于可以不必去读那些令我提不起丝毫兴趣的课程了。然后我还可以去修那些看起来有点意思的课程。</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">It wasn&#39;t all romantic. I
        didn&#39;t have a dorm room, so I slept on the floor in friends&#39; rooms, I returned coke bottles for the 5¢
        deposits to buy food with, and I would walk the 7 miles across town every Sunday night to get one good meal a
        week at the Hare Krishna temple. I loved it. And much of what I stumbled into by following my curiosity and
        intuition turned out to be priceless later on. Let me give you one example:</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
    <p class="s2" style="padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">但是这并不是那么罗曼蒂克。我失去了我的宿舍<span
            class="p">,</span>所以我只能在朋友房间的</p>
    <p class="s2" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">地板上面睡觉<span
            class="p">,</span>我去捡 <span class="p">5 </span>美分的可乐瓶子，仅仅为了填饱肚子<span class="p">, </span>在星期天的晚上<span
            class="p">,</span>我需要走七英里的路程，穿过这个城市到 <span class="p">Hare Krishna </span>寺庙<span class="p">(</span>注：位于纽约
        <span class="p">Brooklyn </span>下城<span class="p">),</span>只是为了能吃上饭——这个星期唯一一顿好一点的饭。但是我喜欢这样。我跟着我的直觉和好奇心走<span
            class="p">, </span>遇到的很多东西<span class="p">,</span>此后被证明是无价之宝。让我给你们举一个例子吧：</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">Reed College at that time
        offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country. Throughout the campus every poster, every label
        on every drawer, was beautifully hand calligraphed. Because I had dropped out and didn&#39;t have to take the
        normal classes, I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 24pt;text-align: justify;">Reed<span
            class="s2">大学在那时提供也许是全美最好的美术字课程。在这个大学里面的每个海报</span>, <span class="s2">每个抽屉的标签上面全都是漂亮的美术字。因为我退学了</span>,
        <span class="s2">没有受到正规的训练</span>, <span class="s2">所以我决定去参加这个课程，去学学怎样写出漂亮的美术字。</span></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">I learned about serif and san
        serif typefaces, about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations, about what makes great
        typography great. It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science can&#39;t capture, and
        I found it fascinating.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
    <p class="s2" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 24pt;text-align: justify;">我学到了 <span class="p">san serif
        </span>和 <span class="p">serif </span>字体<span class="p">, </span>我学会了怎么样在不同的字母组合之中改变空格的长度<span class="p">,
        </span>还有怎么样才能作出最棒的印刷式样。那是一种科学永远不能捕捉到的、美丽的、真实的艺术精妙<span class="p">, </span>我发现那实在是太美妙了。</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">None of this had even a hope of
        any practical application in my life. But ten years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer,
        it all came back to me. And we designed it all into the Mac. It was the first computer with beautiful
        typography. If I had never dropped in on that single course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple
        typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
    <p class="s2" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 24pt;text-align: left;">当时看起来这些东西在我的生命中，好像都没有什么实际应用的可能。但是
        十年之后<span class="p">,</span>当我们在设计第一台 <span class="p">Macintosh </span>电脑的时候<span class="p">,</span>就不是那样了。我把当
        时我学的那些家伙全都设计进了 <span class="p">Mac</span>。那是第一台使用了漂亮的印刷字体的电脑。</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">And since Windows just copied
        the Mac, its likely that no personal computer would have them. If I had never dropped out, I would have never
        dropped in on this calligraphy class, and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they
        do. Of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college. But it was very, very
        clear looking backwards ten years</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">later.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
    <p class="s2" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 24pt;text-align: justify;">如果我当时没有退学<span class="p">,
        </span>就不会有机会去参加这个我感兴趣的美术字课程<span class="p">, Mac
        </span>就不会有这么多丰富的字体，以及赏心悦目的字体间距。那么现在个人电脑就不会有现在这么美妙的字型了。当然我在大学的时候，还不可能把从前的点点滴 滴串连起来<span
            class="p">,</span>但是当我十年后回顾这一切的时候<span class="p">,</span>真的豁然开朗了。</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">Again, you can&#39;t connect
        the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will
        somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">- your gut, destiny, life,
        karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
    <p class="s2" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 24pt;text-align: justify;">
        再次强调，没人可以未卜先知，事与事间的因和果，往往只在回首时显现。你得相信，因和果会在未来生活中联系起来。人总要有些信仰才行，直觉也好，命运也罢，因果轮回，不管什么，去相信因与果的联系，会给你信心去跟从自己的意愿，哪怕离经叛道，也绝不止步，只有这样，才能有所成就。

        <li>
            <p style="padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -26pt;text-align: left;">My second story is about love and loss.
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
            <p class="s2" style="padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">我的第二个故事是关于爱和损失的。</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: justify;">I was lucky <span
                    class="s2">– </span>I found what I loved to do early in life. Woz and I started Apple in my parents
                garage when I was 20. We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of us in a
                garage into a billion company with over 4000 employees. We had just released our finest creation - the
                Macintosh - a year earlier, and I had just turned 30.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
            <p class="s2" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 24pt;text-align: justify;">我非常幸运<span class="p">,
                </span>因为我在很早的时候就找到了我钟爱的东西。<span class="p">Woz </span>和我在二十岁的时候就在父母的车库里面开创了苹果公司。我们工作得很努力<span
                    class="p">, </span>十年之后<span
                    class="p">,</span>这个公司从那两个车库中的穷光蛋发展到了超过四千名的雇员、价值超过二十亿的大公司。在公司成立的第九年<span class="p">,
                </span>我们刚刚发布了最好的产品<span class="p">, </span>那就是 <span class="p">Macintosh</span>。我也快要到三十岁了。</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">And then I got fired.
                How can you get fired from a company you started<span class="s2">？ </span>Well, as Apple grew we hired
                someone who I thought was very talented to run the company with me, and for the first year or so things
                went well. But then our visions of the future began to diverge and eventually we had a falling out. When
                we did, our Board of Directors sided with him. So at 30 I was out. And very publicly out. What had been
                the focus of my entire adult life was gone, and it was devastating.</p>
            <p class="s2" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 24pt;text-align: left;">在那一年<span
                    class="p">, </span>我被炒了鱿鱼。你怎么可能被你自己创立的公司炒了鱿鱼呢？嗯<span
                    class="p">,</span>在苹果快速成长的时候，我们雇用了一个很有天分的家伙和我一起管理这个公司<span class="p">, </span>在最初的几年<span
                    class="p">,</span>公司运转的很好。但是后来我们对未来的看法发生了分歧<span class="p">,</span>最终我们吵了起来。当争吵不可开交的时候<span
                    class="p">, </span>董事会站在了他的那一边。所以在三十岁的时候<span class="p">,
                </span>我被炒了。在这么多人的眼皮下我被炒了。在而立之年，我生命的全部支柱离自己远去<span class="p">, </span>这真是毁灭性的打击。</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">I really didn&#39;t
                know what to do for a few months. I felt that I had let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down -
                that I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me. I met with David Packard and Bob Noyce and
                tried to apologize for screwing up so badly.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
            <p class="s2" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 24pt;text-align: justify;">
                在最初的几个月里，我真是不知道该做些什么。我把从前的创业激情给丢了<span class="p">,</span>我觉得自己让与我一同创业的人都很沮丧。我和 <span class="p">David
                    Pack </span>和 <span class="p">Bob Boyce </span>见面，并试图向他们道歉。</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: justify;">I was a very public
                failure, and I even thought about running away from the valley. But something slowly began to dawn on me
                <span class="s2">– </span>I still loved what I did. The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one
                bit. I had been rejected, but I was still in love. And so I decided to start over.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
            <p class="s2" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 24pt;text-align: justify;">我把事情弄得糟糕透顶了。但是我渐渐发现了曙光<span
                    class="p">, </span>我仍然喜爱我从事的这些东西。苹果公司发生的这些事情丝毫的没有改变这些<span class="p">, </span>一点也没有。我被驱逐了<span
                    class="p">,</span>但是我仍然钟爱它。所以我决定从头再来。</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">I didn&#39;t see it
                then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened
                to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less
                sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
            <p class="s2" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 24pt;text-align: justify;">我当时没有觉察<span class="p">,
                </span>但是事后证明<span class="p">, </span>从苹果公司被炒是我这辈子发生的最棒的事情。因为，作为一个成功者的沉重感觉被作为一个创业者的轻松感觉所重新代替<span
                    class="p">: </span>对任何事情都不那么特别看重。这让我觉得如此自由<span class="p">, </span>进入了我生命中最有创造力的一个阶段。</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">During the next five
                years, I started a company named NeXT, another company named Pixar, and fell in love with an amazing
                woman who would become my wife. Pixar went on to create the worlds first computer animated feature film,
                Toy Story, and is now the most successful animation studio in the world.</p>
            <p class="s2" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 24pt;text-align: justify;">
                在接下来的五年里<span class="p">, </span>我创立了一个名叫 <span class="p">NeXT </span>的公司<span class="p">, </span>还有一个叫
                <span class="p">Pixar</span>的公司<span class="p">, </span>然后和一个后来成为我妻子的优雅女人相识。<span class="p">Pixar
                </span>制作了世界上第一个用电脑制作的动画电影——“玩具总动员”<span class="p">,Pixar </span>现在也是世界上最成功的电脑制作工作室。</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">In a remarkable turn of
                events, Apple bought NeXT, I returned to Apple, and the technology we developed at NeXT is at the heart
                of Apple&#39;s current renaissance. And Laurene and I have a wonderful family together.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
            <p class="s2" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 24pt;text-align: left;">在后来的一系列运转中<span class="p">,Apple
                </span>收购了 <span class="p">NeXT, </span>然后我又回到了 <span class="p">Apple </span>公司。我们在 <span class="p">NeXT
                </span>发展的技术在 <span class="p">Apple </span>的复兴之中发挥了关键的作用。我还和 <span class="p">Laurence
                </span>一起建立了一个幸福的家庭。</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">I&#39;m pretty sure
                none of this would have happened if I hadn&#39;t been fired from Apple. It was awful tasting medicine,
                but I guess the patient needed it. Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don&#39;t lose
                faith. I&#39;m convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did. You&#39;ve
                got to find what you love. And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers. Your work is
                going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you
                believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven&#39;t
                found it yet, keep looking. Don&#39;t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you&#39;ll know when you
                find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep
                looking until you find it. Don&#39;t settle.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
            <p class="s2" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 24pt;text-align: justify;">我可以非常肯定<span
                    class="p">,</span>如果我不被<span class="p">Apple </span>开除的话<span class="p">,
                </span>这其中一件事情也不会发生的。这个良药的味道实在是太苦了<span
                    class="p">,</span>但是我想病人需要这个药。有时候生活会给你迎头一击，不要灰心丧气。我坚信，唯一可以让我坚持下去的，就是我对自己事业的热爱。你必须去寻找自己所爱，无论是工作还是爱情，都是如此。工作是生活中很主要的部分，真正获得满足感，就必须做你相信是有价值的工作。要做有价值的事业，你就必须热爱你做的事业，如果你还没找到，千万不要放弃，要继续寻找，只要倾听你的心声，当你真的发现时你就会感到，就像任何伟大的感情关系一样，岁月的更迭只会让这份情愈发深刻，所以千万不要放弃，要继续寻找。

    <p class="s2" style="padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">我的第三个故事是关于死亡的。</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">When I was 17, I read a quote
        that went something like: &quot;If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you&#39;ll most certainly
    </p>
    <p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: justify;">be
        right.&quot; It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror
        every morning and asked myself: &quot;If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about
        to do today<span class="s2">？</span>&quot; And whenever the answer has been &quot;No&quot; for too many days in
        a row, I know I need to change something.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
    <p class="s2" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 24pt;text-align: justify;">当我十七岁的时候<span class="p">,
        </span>我读到了一句话<span class="p">:</span>“如果你把每一天都当作生命中最后一天去生活的话<span
            class="p">,</span>那么有一天你会发现你是正确的。”这句话给我留下了深刻的印象。从那时开始<span class="p">,</span>过了 <span class="p">33
        </span>年<span class="p">,</span>我在每天早晨都会对着镜子问自己<span class="p">:</span>“如果今天是我生命中的最后一天<span class="p">,
        </span>你会不会完成你今天想做的事情呢？”当答案连续很多次被给予“不是”的时候<span class="p">, </span>我知道自己需要改变某些事情了。</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">Remembering that I&#39;ll be
        dead soon is the most important tool I&#39;ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because
        almost everything <span class="s2">– </span>all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or
        failure - these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering
        that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You
        are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
    <p class="s2" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 24pt;text-align: justify;">
        提醒自己人的生命有限，令我一生都受益非常，令我能在人生重大问题上做出抉择。因为一切的一切，一切追求，一切荣耀，一切惶恐，一些挫折，在死亡面前都会显得微不足道
        ，剩下的才是最重要的事情。记住自己总会死去是避免自己被种种担心所羁绊的最好方法，既然将一无所有，还有什么理由不追随自己的内心。</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">About a year ago I was
        diagnosed with cancer. I had a scan at 7:30 in the morning, and it clearly showed a tumor on my pancreas. I
        didn&#39;t even know what a pancreas was. The doctors told me this was almost certainly a type of cancer that is
        incurable, and that I should expect to live no longer than three to six months. My doctor advised me to go home
        and get my affairs in order, which is doctor&#39;s code for prepare to die. It means to try to tell your kids
        everything you thought you&#39;d have the next 10 years to tell them in just a few months. It means to make sure
        everything is buttoned up so that it will be as easy as possible for your family. It means to say your goodbyes.
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
    <p class="s2" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 24pt;text-align: justify;">大概一年以前<span class="p">,
        </span>我被诊断出癌症。我在早晨七点半做了一个检查<span class="p">, </span>检查清楚的显示在我的胰腺有一个肿瘤。我当时都不知道胰腺是什么东西。医生告诉我那很可能是一种无法治愈的癌症<span
            class="p">, </span>我还有三到六个月的时间活在这个世界上。我的医生叫我回家<span class="p">, </span>然后整理好我的一切<span class="p">,
        </span>那就是医生准备死亡的程序。那意味着你将要把未来十年对你小孩说的话在几个月里面说完<span class="p">.;</span>那意味着把每件事情都搞</p>
    <p class="s2" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">定<span class="p">,
        </span>让你的家人会尽可能轻松的生活<span class="p">;</span>那意味着你要说“再见了”。</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">I lived with that diagnosis all
        day. Later that evening I had a biopsy, where they stuck an endoscope down my throat, through my stomach and
        into my intestines, put a needle into my pancreas and got a few cells from the tumor. I was sedated, but my
        wife, who was there, told me that when they viewed the cells under a microscope the doctors started crying
        because it turned out to be a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that is curable with surgery. I had the
        surgery and I&#39;m fine now.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
    <p class="s2" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 24pt;text-align: left;">
        我整天和那个诊断书一起生活。后来有一天早上我作了一个活切片检查，医生将一个内窥镜从我的喉咙伸进去<span class="p">,</span>通过我的胃<span class="p">,
        </span>然后进入我的肠子<span class="p">, </span>用一根针在我的胰腺上的肿瘤上取了几个细胞。我当时很镇静<span
            class="p">,</span>因为我被注射了镇定剂。但是我的妻子在那里<span class="p">, </span>后来告诉我，当医生在显微镜地下观察这些细胞的时候他们开始尖叫<span
            class="p">, </span>因为这些细胞最后竟然是一种非常罕见的可以用手术治愈的胰腺癌症。我做了这个手术<span class="p">, </span>现在我痊愈了。</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">This was the closest I&#39;ve
        been to facing death, and I hope its the closest I get for a few more decades. Having lived through it, I can
        now say this to you with a bit more certainty than when death was a useful but purely intellectual concept:</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
    <p class="s2" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 24pt;text-align: justify;">那是我最接近死亡的时候<span class="p">,
        </span>我还希望这也是以后的几十年最接近的一次。从死亡线上又活了过来<span class="p">, </span>死亡对我来说，只是一个有用但是纯粹是知识上的概念的时候，我可以更肯定一点地对你们说：</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">No one wants to die. Even
        people who want to go to heaven don&#39;t want to die to get there. And yet death is the destination we all
        share. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be, because Death is very likely the single best
        invention of Life. It is Life&#39;s change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new. Right now the
        new is you, but someday not too long from now, you will gradually become the old and be cleared away. Sorry to
        be so dramatic, but it is quite true.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
    <p class="s2" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 24pt;text-align: justify;">没有人愿意死<span class="p">,
        </span>即使人们想上天堂<span class="p">, </span>人们也不会为了去那里而死。但是死亡是我们每个人共同的终点。从来没有人能够逃脱它。也应该如此。
        因为死亡就是生命中最好的一个发明。它将旧的清除以便给新的让路。你们现在是新的<span class="p">, </span>但是从现在开始不久以后<span class="p">,
        </span>你们将会逐渐的变成旧的然后被清除。我很抱歉这很戏剧性<span class="p">, </span>但是这十分的真实。</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">Your time is limited, so
        don&#39;t waste it living someone else&#39;s life. Don&#39;t be trapped by dogma - which is living with the
        results of</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">other
        people&#39;s thinking. Don&#39;t let the noise of other&#39;s opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most
        important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to
        become. Everything else is secondary.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
    <p class="s2" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">人生有限，所以不要把时间浪费在重复其他人的生活上<span
            class="p">;</span>不要被教条束缚，那只是根据别人的思维结果而生活，不要让他人的喧嚣纷繁，淹没了自己内心的声音。最重要的是，你要有勇气去跟随你的直觉和心灵，因为它们在某种程度上已经知道你想要成为什么样子，所有其他的事情都是次要的。

    <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">When I was young, there was an
        amazing publication called The Whole Earth Catalog, which was one of the bibles of my generation. It was created
        by a fellow named Stewart Brand not far from here in Menlo Park, and he brought it to life with his poetic
        touch. This was in the late 1960&#39;s, before personal computers and desktop publishing, so it was all made
        with typewriters, scissors, and polaroid cameras. It was sort of like Google in paperback form,</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">35 years before Google came
        along: it was idealistic, and overflowing with neat tools and great notions.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
    <p class="s2" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 24pt;text-align: justify;">
        在我年轻的时候，有本很棒的叫全球目录的杂志。被我们那代人奉为经典。它是由斯图尔特·布兰德在这附近的 <span class="p">Menlo
        </span>公园创办的。他把自己的文艺气质融汇其中。那是六十年代后期。那时还没有个人电脑。全用打字机，剪刀和宝丽来照相机。它就好比是三十五年前的简装版的谷歌。充满理想主义色彩。该书简洁实用，见解独到。</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">Stewart and his team put out
        several issues of The Whole Earth Catalog, and then when it had run its course, they put out a final issue. It
        was the mid-1970s, and I was your age. On the back cover of their final issue was a photograph of an early
        morning country road, the kind you might find yourself hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous. Beneath it
        were the words: &quot;Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.&quot; It was their farewell message as they signed off. Stay
        Hungry. Stay Foolish. And I have always wished that for myself. And now, as you graduate to begin anew, I wish
        that for you.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 222%;text-align: left;">Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish. Thank
        you all very much.</p>
    <p class="s2" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 24pt;text-align: justify;">
        斯图尔特团队出版了几期的全球目录。当它后来要停刊的时候，他们出来最后一版。那是七十年代中期，我就像你们这么大。杂志最后一期的封底上，是一幅清晨乡村公路的照片。是那种搭车旅行玩冒险时会遇到的村路，照片下面有这样一段话：求知若渴，虚心若愚。这是他们停刊的告别语。求知若渴，虚心若愚。我
    </p>
    <p class="s2" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 195%;text-align: left;">
        一直以此激励自己。在你们即将毕业开始崭新旅程的时刻，我希望你们也能做到：求知若渴，虚心若愚。</p>
    <p class="s2" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 16pt;text-align: left;">谢谢大家。</p>

    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;font-size: 18pt;">Steve JoBs' commencement address</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">I am honored to be with you today at your
        commencement from one of the finest universities in the world. I never graduated from college. Truth be told,
        this is the closest I<span class="s2">’</span>ve ever gotten to a college graduation. Today I want to tell you
        three stories from my life. That<span class="s2">’</span>s it. No big deal. Just three stories.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The first story is about connecting the dots.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">I dropped out of Reed College
        after the first 6 months, but then stayed around as a drop-in for another 18 months or so before I really quit.
        So why did I drop out?</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: justify;">It started before I was born.
        My biological mother was a young, unwed college graduate student, and she decided to put me up for adoption. She
        felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college graduates, so everything was all set for me to be adopted
        at birth by a lawyer and his wife. Except that when I popped out they decided at the last minute that they
        really wanted a girl. So my parents, who were on a waiting list, got a call in the middle of the night asking:
        <span class="s2">“</span>We have an unexpected baby boy; do you want him?<span class="s2">” </span>They</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">said: <span
            class="s2">“</span>Of course.<span class="s2">” </span>My biological mother later found out that my</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">mother had never graduated from
        college and that my father had never graduated from high school. She refused to sign the final adoption papers.
        She only relented a few months later when my parents promised that I would someday go to college.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: justify;">And 17 years later I did go to
        college. But I naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as Stanford, and all of my working-class
        parents<span class="s2">’ </span>savings were being spent on my college tuition. After six months, I couldn<span
            class="s2">’</span>t see the value in it. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and no idea how
        college was going to help me figure it out. And here I was spending all of the money my parents had saved their
        entire life. So I decided</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">to drop out and trust that it
        would all work out OK. It was pretty scary at the time, but looking back it was one of the best decisions I ever
        made. The minute I dropped out I could stop taking the required classes that didn<span class="s2">’</span>t
        interest me, and begin dropping in on the ones</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">that looked interesting.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: justify;">It wasn't all romantic. 
        I didn't have a dorm room, so I slept on the floor in friends'rooms, I returned coke bottles for the 5 deposits to buy food with,
        and I would walk the 7 miles across town every Sunday night to get one good meal a week at the Hare Krishna
        temple. I loved it. And much of what I stumbled into by following my curiosity and intuition
        turned out to be priceless later on. Let me give you one example:</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">Reed College at that time
        offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country. Throughout the campus every poster, every label
        on every drawer, was beautifully hand calligraphed. Because I had dropped out and didn<span class="s2">’</span>t
        have to take the normal classes, I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this. I learned about
        serif and san serif typefaces, about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations, about
        what makes great typography great. It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science
        can<span class="s2">’</span>t capture, and I found it fascinating.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">None of this had even a hope of
        any practical application in my life. But ten years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer,
        it all came back to me. And we designed it all into the Mac. It was the first computer with beautiful
        typography. If I had never dropped in on that single course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple
        typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts. And since Windows just copied the Mac, its likely that no personal
        computer would have them. If I had never dropped out, I would have never dropped in on this calligraphy class,
        and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do. Of course it was impossible to
        connect the dots looking forward when I was in college. But it was very, very clear looking backwards ten years
        later.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">Again, you can<span
            class="s2">’</span>t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you
        have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">- your gut, destiny, life,
        karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">My second story is about love and loss.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I was lucky - I found what I loved to do early in
        life. Woz and</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">I started
        Apple in my parents garage when I was 20. We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of
        us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4000 employees. We had just released our finest creation -
        the Macintosh - a year earlier, and I had just turned 30. And then I got fired. How can you get fired from a
        company you started? Well, as Apple grew we hired someone who I thought was very talented to run the company
        with me, and for the first year or so things went well. But then our visions of the future began to diverge and
        eventually we had a falling out. When we did, our Board of Directors sided with him. So at 30 I was out. And
        very publicly out. What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone, and it was devastating.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: justify;">I really didn<span
            class="s2">’</span>t know what to do for a few months. I felt that I had let the previous generation of
        entrepreneurs down - that I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me. I met with David Packard and Bob
        Noyce and tried to apologize for screwing up so badly. I was a very public failure, and I even thought about
        running away from the valley. But something slowly began to dawn on me - I still loved what I did. The turn of
        events at Apple had not changed that one bit. I had been rejected, but I was still in love. And so I decided to
        start over.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">I didn<span
            class="s2">’</span>t see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that
        could have ever happened to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a
        beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">During the next five years, I
        started a company named NeXT, another company named Pixar, and fell in love with an amazing woman who would
        become my wife. Pixar went on to create the worlds first computer animated feature film, Toy Story, and is now
        the most successful animation studio in the world. In a remarkable turn of events, Apple bought NeXT, I returned
        to Apple, and the technology we developed at NeXT is at the heart of Apple<span class="s2">’</span>s current
        renaissance. And Laurene and I have a wonderful family together.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">I<span class="s2">’</span>m pretty sure none of
        this would have happened if I hadn<span class="s2">’</span>t been fired from Apple. It was awful tasting
        medicine, but I guess the patient needed it. Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don<span
            class="s2">’</span>t lose faith. I<span class="s2">’</span>m convinced that the only thing that kept me
        going was that I loved what I did. You<span class="s2">’</span>ve got to find what you love. And that is as true
        for your work as it is for your lovers. Your</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">work is going to fill a large part
        of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way
        to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven<span class="s2">’ </span>t found it yet, keep looking.
        Don<span class="s2">’</span>t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you<span class="s2">’</span>ll know when
        you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep
        looking until you find it. Don<span class="s2">’</span>t settle.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">My third story is about death.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">When I was 17, I read a quote that went something
        like: <span class="s2">“</span>If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you<span
            class="s2">’</span>ll most certainly be right.<span class="s2">” </span>It made an impression on me, and
        since then, for the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: <span
            class="s2">“</span>If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do
        today?<span class="s2">” </span>And whenever the answer has been <span class="s2">“</span>No<span class="s2">”
        </span>for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Remembering that I<span
            class="s2">’</span>ll be dead soon is the most important tool I<span class="s2">’ </span>ve ever encountered
        to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything - all external expectations, all pride, all
        fear of embarrassment or failure - these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly
        important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have
        something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">About a year ago I was diagnosed
        with cancer. I had a scan at 7:30 in the morning, and it clearly showed a tumor on my pancreas. I didn<span
            class="s2">’</span>t even know what a pancreas was. The doctors told me this was almost certainly a type of
        cancer that is incurable, and that I should expect to live no longer than three to six months. My doctor advised
        me to go home and get my affairs in order, which is doctor<span class="s2">’ </span>s code for prepare to die.
        It means to try to tell your kids everything you thought you<span class="s2">’</span>d have the next 10 years to
        tell them in just a few months. It means to make sure everything is buttoned up so that it will be as easy as
        possible for your family. It means to say your goodbyes.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">I lived with that diagnosis all
        day. Later that evening I had a biopsy, where they stuck an endoscope down my throat, through my stomach and
        into my intestines, put a needle into my pancreas and got a few cells from the tumor. I was sedated, but my
        wife, who was there, told me that when they viewed the cells under a microscope</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: justify;">the doctors
        started crying because it turned out to be a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that is curable with surgery. I
        had the surgery and I<span class="s2">’</span>m fine now.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">This was the closest I<span
            class="s2">’</span>ve been to facing death, and I hope its the closest I get for a few more decades. Having
        lived through it, I can now say this to you with a bit more certainty than when death was a useful but purely
        intellectual concept:</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">No one wants to die. Even
        people who want to go to heaven don<span class="s2">’</span>t want to die to get there. And yet death is the
        destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be, because Death is very likely
        the single best invention of Life. It is Life<span class="s2">’</span>s change agent. It clears out the old to
        make way for the new. Right now the new is you, but someday not too long from now, you will gradually become the
        old and be cleared away. Sorry to be so dramatic, but it is quite true.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Your time is limited, so don<span
            class="s2">’</span>t waste it living someone else’s life. Don<span class="s2">’</span>t be trapped by dogma
        - which is living with the results of other people<span class="s2">’</span>s thinking. Don<span
            class="s2">’</span>t let the noise of other<span class="s2">’</span>s opinions drown out your own inner
        voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what
        you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">When I was young, there was an
        amazing publication called The Whole Earth Catalog, which was one of the bibles of my generation. It was created
        by a fellow named Stewart Brand not far from here in Menlo Park, and he brought it to life with his poetic
        touch. This was in the late 1960<span class="s2">’</span>s, before personal computers and desktop publishing, so
        it was all made with typewriters, scissors, and polaroid cameras. It was sort of like Google in paperback form,
    </p>
    <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">35 years before Google came
        along: it was idealistic, and overflowing with neat tools and great notions.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">Stewart and his team put out
        several issues of The Whole Earth Catalog, and then when it had run its course, they put out a final issue. It
        was the mid-1970s, and I was your age. On the back cover of their final issue was a photograph of an early
        morning country road, the kind you might find yourself hitchhiking on if you were</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 15pt;text-align: justify;">so adventurous. Beneath it were
        the words: <span class="s2">“</span>Stay Hungry. Stay</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">Foolish.<span class="s2">”
        </span>It was their farewell message as they signed off. Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish. And I have always wished
        that for myself. And now, as you graduate to begin anew, I wish that for you.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>
    <p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 222%;text-align: left;">Stay Hungry. Stay
        Foolish. Thank you all very much.</p>
